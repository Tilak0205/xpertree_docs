      "Osimertinib is a 3rd-generation, CNS-active, EGFR-TKI with superior efficacy to comparator EGFR-TKI (gefitinib/erlotinib) in treatment-naïve EGFRm advanced NSCLC. Approx. 30% of pts with NSCLC present with early stage (I–IIIA) disease; surgery is the primary treatment. Adjuvant chemotherapy is standard of care in pts with resected stage II–III NSCLC and select stage IB pts; however, recurrence rates are high and other therapies are needed.

      "Bone destruction is a devastating consequence of multiple myeloma (MM). An unmet medical need exists for the management of skeletal complications in MM patients with renal insufficiency. Despite the effectiveness of intravenous bisphosphonates, their use is limited in situations where renal dysfunction is present. Denosumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG2 antibody to RANKL that has been shown to be non-inferior to zoledronic acid for SRE rates in MM (Raje, et al. Lancet Oncol). More importantly, it does not have the same renal toxicity as the bisphosphonates. We hypothesize that denosumab can be safely and effectively administered in MM patients with renal insufficiency to improve bone health. This may fill a gap in clinical care for bone-directed therapy in this patient population.\n",

TBCRC011 established the safety and efficacy of inhibiting AR with bicalutamide (B) in patients (pts) with AR+/ER/PR- metastatic BC (MBC) with a median progression free survival (PFS) of 12 weeks (wks) (95% CI, 11–22 wks). In preclinical data, palbociclib (P) has been shown to reduce growth of AR+/ER/PR- MDA-MB-453 BC cells. It has been shown that AR+ triple negative BC (TNBC) expresses a luminal profile and has intact Rb protein, the target of P activity. We conducted this Phase I/II trial of the AR inhibitor B in combination with the CDK4/6 inhibitor P in pts with AR+/ER/PR/HER2- BC (NCT02605486) to test the hypothesis that androgen blockade, paired with CDK4/6 inhibition would have increased efficacy in pts with androgen-dependent BC.\n",

      "Continuous combination of MAPK inhibition (MAPKi) and anti-PD-(L)1 has been investigated by several trials to improve outcome of BRAFV600 mutated melanoma patients. A major obstacle for continuous combination is the high frequency (~60%) of grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events (TRAE) for which many patients need to discontinue (~40%). In a preclinical model we showed that short‐time MAPKi induces T cell infiltration and is synergistic with anti-PD‐1. In patients T cell infiltration increased after short-term MAPKi, while after > 2 weeks this was often diminished. The aim of this phase 2b study was to identify the optimal duration of MAPKi with dabrafenib (BRAFi) + trametinib (MEKi) in combination with pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1) in terms of safety, feasibility and immune-activating capacity.\n",

      "Germline TP53 mutations are associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS). However, approximately 20% of commercial laboratory multigene panel test (MGPT)-detected pathogenic TP53 variants represent aberrant clonal expansion (ACE), rather than a germline finding, and are often detected in individuals that lack classic features of LFS. Clonal hematopoiesis (CH) is a form of ACE, and in the absence of an abnormal hemogram is termed Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). CHIP is often associated with a pathogenic variant (PV) in hematopoietic pathway gene(s) at a variant allele frequency (VAF) less than expected for a heterozygous germline finding. The prevalence increases with age and exposure to chemotherapy. The presence of a skewed VAF is usually noted in a comment on a genetic test result, however, clinicians without genetic training often lack understanding of the comment and need strategies to discern the difference between germline findings, CHIP, and post-zygotic mosaicism. Our studies illuminate possible strategies for discernment for clinicians.\n",

Here, we leveraged deep learning approaches to expand the diagnostic utility of genetic analysis in cancer patients.\n",

      "It is critical for oncologists to be aware of unbiased and interpretable cancer risks (i.e., penetrance) in carriers with germline pathogenic variants in cancer susceptibility genes. However, relevant literature is large and varies significantly in study design, patient ascertainment, and types of risk estimates reported. This heterogeneity can cause inconsistent conclusions between studies and create barriers for clinicians to understand and apply them in practice. To further understand the current literature, we assessed penetrance studies associated with non-BRCA breast cancer susceptibility genes based on study design and ascertainment adjustment.\n",

      "Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) has been described in blood samples from large series of patients. Its prevalence and consequences remain questioned because sequencing methods vary and because most studies were performed in cohorts of individuals suffering from non-hematological diseases (solid cancers, diabetes, cardiovascular or psychiatric diseases). CHIP has been described as a risk factor for blood cancer. However, the diagnosis of most blood cancers relies on morphologic and genetic examination of the bone marrow, and clonal hematopoiesis has never been evaluated in bone marrow samples from healthy individuals. Hence, it is not clear whether the current definition of CHIP is clinically relevant. To address this issue, we studied clonal hematopoiesis in paired peripheral blood and bone marrow samples from an unprecedented cohort of rigorously selected healthy volunteers.\n",

      "Timely integration of palliative care in the management of patients with advanced cancer is a quality benchmark in oncology. However, PC is often underutilized as evidenced by delays in identification of appropriate patients, in referrals to a PC service, and in enrollment to hospice. Jvion has developed a prescriptive analytics solution, the Machine, which combines AI algorithms with machine learning techniques and applies them to clinical and exogenous datasets to identify patients with a propensity for poor outcomes. The Machine was applied to risk for patients’ mortality within next 30 days, and recommended patient-specific, dynamic, and actionable insights. Use of the Machine requires no additional documentation within the electronic health record (EHR) and the insights generated can be integrated back in to any EHR to help inform the care plan. Herein, we report the results of a study evaluating the impact of AI-driven insights on PC utilization at a large community oncology practice.\n",

In oncology, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) measure is commonly used. Patient-reported functional status (PRFS) is an emerging method that allows patients to provide an estimate of their function; however, there is limited information about its prognostic significance in solid tumors. We explored the prognostic value of PRFS in comparison to ECOG on survival.\n",
      "Chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T) therapy can lead to durable responses in chemorefractory patients with hematologic malignancies. CAR-T, however, can be associated with neurotoxicity. There is a significant body of literature describing patient-reported concerns with cognition in hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients, a similar treatment group. However, little is known about subjective cognition in CAR-T patients. This study examined changes in subjective cognition over time in CAR-T recipients and compared their outcomes with allogeneic HCT recipients.\n",

      "The acquisition of ligand-independent ESR1 mutations during endocrine therapy in metastatic ER+ breast cancer is a common mechanism of resistance to endocrine treatment, particularly aromatase inhibitors, and found in more than 30% of patients with metastatic ER+ breast cancer. Our recent work showed that the ER mutations confer resistance to currently available endocrine treatments while promoting an aberrant ER transcriptional activity that drives metastases. These results underscore the importance of targeting the ESR1 mutations even after the development of endocrine resistance. We hypothesized that during chemotherapy treatment, the ESR1 mutations remain an important driver of tumor growth and metastases and therefore drugs targeting the ESR1 mutation could enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy. In this study we investigated the combination of chemotherapy with the selective estrogen receptor degrader in the presence of WT and mutant ER.\n",

      "T-DXd is an antibody-drug conjugate composed of an anti-HER2 antibody, cleavable tetrapeptide-based linker, and potent topoisomerase I inhibitor. In a phase II trial in patients (pts) with heavily pretreated, metastatic HER2+ breast cancer (BC), T-DXd had a confirmed objective response rate (cORR) of 60.9% (112/184) and median progression-free survival (PFS) of 16.4 mo (Modi N Engl J Med 2019); these results led to the recent FDA approval for HER2+ unresectable or metastatic BC after ≥ 2 prior anti-HER2 based regimens. For HER2-low BC and HER2-expressing/mutated NSCLC, no HER2-directed therapies have been approved. In a phase I trial of T-DXd in pts with HER2-low BC or HER2-expressing/mutated NSCLC, cORR was 44.2% (19/43) (Modi SABCS 2018), and 55.6% (10/18) (Tsurutani Thorac Oncol 2018), respectively. In preclinical models, T-DXd combined with an anti–PD-1 antibody was more effective than monotherapy with either agent (Iwata Mol Cancer Ther 2018). Here we describe a phase Ib study of T-DXd in combination with pembrolizumab in pts with locally advanced/metastatic HER2-expressing BC or HER2-expressing/mutated NSCLC (DS8201-A-U106; NCT04042701).\n",

      "While immunostimulatory therapies have shown great success, a major challenge remains identification of mechanisms to effectively treat the majority of patients with so-called \"non-inflamed\" tumors lacking marked lymphocyte infiltration and PD-L1 expression. The DNA repair proficiency of a tumor may impact its potential for immune recognition and sensitivity to immune checkpoint blockade. Preclinically, PARP inhibition in HDR-deficient tumors has been shown to trigger antitumor immunity through a STING-dependent antitumor immune response. Effects of PARP inhibitors were augmented when combined with PD-1 blockade.

We hypothesize that enhanced DNA damage and cell death induced by PARP inhibition in tumors with homology directed repair (HDR) deficiency will enhance adaptive anti-tumor immune responses and increase sensitivity to PD-1 axis blockers.\n",
      "Metastatic HER2+ breast cancer, while initially responsive to trastuzumab, pertuzumab, and TDM-1, eventually progresses. The FDA recently approved trastuzumab deruxtecan, showing benefit in progression free survival but not in overall survival to date. Thus, additional therapies are needed for patients who progress on these HER2 directed agents. In metastatic HER2+ breast cancer, HER2-specific Th1 immune responses and higher CD4+ Th1 and CD8+ TIL levels are associated with a survival benefit. As this Type 1 immunity occurs in a minority of patients, additional immune modulation is needed. Alpha-tocopheryloxyacetic acid (α-TEA) has been reported to augment Type 1 immunity through increasing activated effector memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and decreasing immune suppressive CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment. When given concurrently with an anti-HER2 antibody (7.16.4) in a pre-clinical tumor model, α-TEA synergized with 7.16.4 to induce tumor regression. We hypothesize that α-TEA and trastuzumab combination therapy in metastatic HER2+ breast cancer will be well tolerated, induce a clinical response, and augment anti-tumor Th1 immunity.\n",

      "LIV-1 is a highly prevalent transmembrane protein in breast cancer cells. Ladiratuzumab vedotin (LV), SGN-LIV1A, is an investigational antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that targets LIV-1 via a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody conjugated to monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) by a protease-cleavable linker. LV is internalized when it binds LIV-1 on cell surfaces and MMAE is released, which binds tubulin and induces apoptosis. LV has been shown to be active and tolerable in metastatic breast cancer (mBC) at a recommended dose of 2.5 mg/kg every 21 days (Modi 2017). More frequent, fractionated dosing has improved the activity and/or safety of other ADCs.

LV has been shown to be active and tolerable in metastatic breast cancer (mBC) at a recommended dose of 2.5 mg/kg every 21 days (Modi 2017). More frequent, fractionated dosing has improved the activity and/or safety of other ADCs. Thus, this study is actively accruing subjects with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (mTNBC; estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) receptor-negative) and endocrine-resistant ER+ or PR+ (hormone receptor [HR+])/HER2-negative mBC to test weekly dosing of LV (Days 1, 8, and 15 of every 3-week cycle).\n",

RSK1-3 phosphorylates transcription factors, including Y-box binding protein-1 (YB-1), thereby inducing drug resistance and cancer growth genes. Phosphorylated YB-1 is involved in tumor cell survival, proliferation, and drug resistance. In human breast tumor samples, RSK2 protein is expressed across all breast cancer subtypes (TNBC, ER+ and HER2+) and is associated with poor overall survival. Expression of RSK2 is found in approximately 87% of mTNBC tumors and of those tumors approximately 41% have very high expression of RSK2. PMD-026 is a potent, oral, small molecule RSK inhibitor with high selectivity for RSK2.

      "Patients with metastatic triple negative breast cancer (mTNBC) have limited treatment options. Recent studies with a PD-L1 inhibitor and taxane based chemotherapy have demonstrated an increase in median progression free survival (PFS) in mTNBC. While taxanes target microtubules, platinum agents directly alkylate DNA and may generate additional neoantigens to enhance anti-tumor immunity via immune checkpoint inhibition. In this study, we are evaluating the combination of carboplatin with and without atezolizumab in patients with mTNBC. Serial biopsies are poised to help elucidate biological differences in responders and nonresponders. As optimal timing of adding checkpoint inhibition to chemotherapy is debatable, the randomized, crossover design will give insight into whether priming mTNBCs with DNA damaging chemotherapy results in cellular and immune changes that lead to a greater likelihood of response.\n",

Given the inflammatory nature of this disease and the association of programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) expression with lymphovascular invasion, we hypothesized that the combination of pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, with carboplatin may be effective as treatment for breast cancer chest wall recurrences.\n",
      "It is estimated that there are approximately 155,000 people living with metastatic breast cancer in the US. Studies exploring the connection between hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism and breast cancer have yielded varying results with up to 33% prevalence of thyroid disease in these patients. L-thyroxine (T4) is the most commonly prescribed agent in the US to manage hypothyroidism. However, there are data suggesting that T4 is a pro-oncogenic agent with proposed mechanisms such as stimulation of mitogenesis, angiogenesis, resistance to apoptosis. In addition, T4 May counter anti-PDL-1 and radiation effects. Triiodothyronine (T3), which is deiodinated form of T4 and also commercially available, is felt to be less oncogenic and less mitogenic. Therefore, exogenous supplementation of T3 would decrease the T4 levels creating the desired state of EUTHYROID HYPOTHYROXINEMIA. The study hypothesizes that replacing L-thyroxine (T4) with Triiodothyronine (T3) in hypothyroid patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, while they simultaneously continue to receive standard systemic therapy, with titrating T3 dose to achieve a state of Euthyroid Hypothyroxinemia would result in improved disease outcomes.\n",

      "Evidence suggests continuing endocrine therapy (ET) beyond 5 years (yr) may reduce breast cancer recurrence in early stage HR+ breast cancers. Given the modest benefit and potentially serious adverse effects of extended ET (EET), improved approaches to identify patients who are at increased risk of late distant recurrence and who derive benefit from EET are critical. Guidelines recommend shared decision-making between oncologists and patients. The adherence rate to EET by 5 yr is only 50-60%.
