      "techniques for diagnostic and interventional angiographic applications, and share lessons learned from the successes and challenges\n",
      "of these efforts.  Specifically, we will begin with the origins of 2D  Digital  Subtraction  Angiography (DSA) which has facilitated the\n",
      "development of interventional radiology. Subsequently the need for time-resolved MRA data led to the creation of accelerated data\n",
      "acquisition schemes in MR angiography which introduced the general concept of under-sampled data acquisition in the time domain.\n",
      "These efforts led to the development of time-resolved 3D Time-Resolved Imaging of Contrast Kinetics (3D-TRICKS MRA), an analog\n",
      "of  X-ray  DSA. Partnerships between academia and industry were key factors in the dissemination of these methods to ultimately\n",
      "benefit  human  health. The  concept  of  under-sampling  in  MR  angiography  was  then  extended  to  the  spatial  domain  using  radial\n",

      "functional assessment of vascular health and disease. The simultaneous spatial and temporal under-sampling methods developed for\n",
      "MRA have since been applied to cone-beam x-ray  CTA, therefore creating 4D  DSA, a time-resolved 3D version of  DSA capable of\n",
      "measuring  of  blood  velocities.  All  of  these  developments  were  grounded  in  physical  principles,  developed  in  response  to  clinical\n",

      "Diagnostic Radiology and Radiation Oncology have been closely aligned since their evolution from a single specialty, often residing in\n",
      "the same department, to the present day. Increasingly, imaging has proven essential to the successful design and delivery of\n",
      "radiation therapy for cancer. In the 1980s, when CT scanners became available, these machines were shared and used selectively\n",
      "for radiation treatment planning. Image-based planning then evolved such that CT simulators became standard equipment in\n",
      "radiation oncology departments. However, diagnostic CT images remained integral to the staging and follow up of patients treated\n",
      "by radiation oncologists. Magnetic resonance imaging more slowly integrated into radiation planning and delivery systems, but used\n",
      "for diagnostic purposes, it gave radiation oncologists critical information about the cancers they were treating with the excellent\n",
      "soft tissue resolution provided by these images. Initially fused with radiation planning images, MR imaging has also gradually moved\n",
      "into radiation oncology departments for external beam and brachytherapy planning, especially for gynecologic cancers. Recently,\n",
      "linear accelerators equipped with online MR imaging capabilities have enabled real time monitoring of tumor and organ motion during\n",
      "each treatment as well as the ability to adapt the dose specification as tumors change over the course of treatment. Defining and\n",
      "treating cancers with this level of precision has allowed for dose escalation with or without treatment acceleration, improved cure\n",
      "rates and decreased morbidity. In addition, these images themselves have become biomarkers, informing radiation oncologists of\n",
      "tumor response and identifying radiomic features, previously untapped, which provide a window into prognosis. PET imaging has\n",
      "provided similar diagnostic and prognostic information. Use of ultrasound to guide invasive brachytherapy procedures is an\n",
      "invaluable asset ensuring procedural accuracy and safety. Interventional radiology has further enabled strategic placement of\n",
      "radiation as well as expertise in mitigating radiation morbidity such as insufficiency fractures. Though often working apart,\n",
      "diagnostic radiologists and the images they interpret and share, are fundamental to the success of radiation therapy. Radiation\n",

      "targetted imaging strategy can be used. This is being explored in the WISDOM and MyPEBS trials where frequency of mammography\n",

      "\n",
      "All current CT scanners use so-called energy integrating detectors (EIDs) to capture incident photons after they pass through the\n",
      "body. The electric current produced by the EID is digitized, and used to reconstruct the digital image from CT. A newer type of\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "detector uses digital technology: the photon counting detector (PCD). As implied by the name, the PCD tracks the individual\n",
      "number of incident photons in addition to the energy of the incident photon. There are two inherent advantages to PCD for human\n",
      "imaging: 1) the potential for lowered radiation dose due to greater efficiency of the PCD, and 2) improved spectral CT imaging.\n",
      "These characteristics further translate to specific advantages for CT of the neurologic imaging. In particular, photon counting CT\n",
      "has been demonstrated to have less beam hardening artifact around the spine and areas of the brain with extensive bone as well\n",
      "as improved gray-white matter differentiation. This results in more accurate quantitative imaging. In addition, PCDs have 2 to 4-fold\n",
      "greater spatial resolution than conventional CT x-ray detectors. The purpose of this review will be to provide background on PCD\n",
      "technology for CT as well as potential advantages or CT imaging of the brain and spine.\n",

      "myocarditis.Methods and Results: Various conditions such as infection or immune response directed against myocardium may result\n",
      "in myocarditis. Before cardiac MRI became available the diagnosis of myocarditis was based on exclusion of other diseases in the\n",
      "context of myocardial injury of unknown cause. Whilst Nuclear Imaging is hampered by poor spatial resolution, Late Gadolinium\n",
      "enhanced MRI (LGE-MRI) was the first technique for imaging myocarditis with high spatial resolution. The advent of T2-mapping\n",
      "enabled distinction of acute myocarditis from scar post myocarditis. Today with T1-mapping before and after contrast\n",
      "administration and Extracellular Volume (ECV)-mapping we have an array of tools in our hands to define disease severity and\n",
      "activity and thus to predict outcome and to guide therapy. Calculation of ECV, however, requires blood sampling for hematocrit.\n",
      "Techniques for ECV-mapping without blood sampling are currently being explored. Today cardiac MRI enables distinction of chronic\n",
      "from healed myocarditis and also dilated cardiomyopathy from chronic myocarditis.Conclusion: Myocarditis can have multiple\n",
      "causes, MRI is modality of choice to identify and characterize myocarditis as well as to predict outcome and guide therapy.\n",

      "For the past several years, the NIH Clinical Center has been routinely producing multimedia-enhanced interactive reports (Folio L.\n",
      "Multimedia Reports. Radiographics. April/ May 2018) in which radiologist reports contain hyperlinked text, directing clinicians to the\n",
      "corresponding image annotation (most often two-diameter measurements). Our prior studies have also demonstrated notable time\n",
      "savings for oncologists (three times faster) when they use the hyperlinked target lesion measurements for their patients (Folio L.\n",
      "RSNA 2015) as they spend significantly less time \"hunting\" for measurements in the previous text-only reports.Bookmark tables\n",
      "within our PACS (VuePACS V12, Carestream Health, Rochester, NY) contain fields where \"radiologist assistants\" (RAs) can label\n",
      "target lesions. In one ongoing study (Toscano A. SCBT.MR 2018), RAs simulate an AI workflow where target lesions are measured\n",
      "before radiologists open the exam for interpretation. This improves target lesion selection and measurement concordance while\n",
      "saving radiologists time by not having to identify or measure these lesions. Once verified, radiologists import the active annotation\n",
      "as a link into our report by dictating the word \"hyperlink,\" which minimizes the potential transcription error of three sets of numbers\n",
      "(measurement, series and image numbers) and other metadata (e.g. x,y image and z table space, comparison of current with prior\n",
      "measurements for RECIST calculations, lesion measurement creator).We have followed adoption of hyperlinks since we started the\n",
      "capability and showed a rapid rise of use and that body radiologists use the most hyperlinks (about 80% of all CT), followed by\n",
      "body MR, PET CT and nueroradiology. We also collect data on use of annotations, with two-diameter the most frequent, followed\n",
      "by linear, ovals then arrows (least frequent). Preliminary work indicates that two-diameter and ovals better guide bounding boxes\n",

      "1) Identify the different imaging modalities that are currently being considered for clinical purposes in psychiatry. 2) Evaluate what\n",
      "the critical test characteristics are that are necessary for an imaging modality to be used as a clinical test. 3) Be able to judge the\n",

      "\n",
      "Neuroimaging techniques have provided a unique and unprecedented insight into the functioning human brain. The emergence of\n",
      "functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) made a tool available that enabled psychiatric researchers to examine with great\n",
      "anatomical detail the relationship between psychological phenomena and brain physiology. Yet, almost thirty years later, it is\n",
      "important to take a step back and examine how this tool has helped to elucidate physiological and pathological anxiety related\n",
      "processes and to specifically address the challenges that lay ahead. Historically, there are currently no biological markers for\n",
      "psychiatric disorders even more than 50 years after the rise of biological psychiatry. Second, most studies that are currently\n",
      "presented are not aimed to examine whether neuroimaging can be used as a biological marker for a particular disorder. Instead,\n",
      "neuroimaging studies focus on the ability to show differences in neural activation due to specific processing of information across\n",
      "groups not within an individual. Third, the characteristics of fMRI, i.e. changing blood flow as a function of energetic demand in\n",
      "parts of the brain, and signal to noise characteristics of fMRI, i.e. the influence of thermal, physical, and physiological noise on the\n",
      "signal, may be such that fMRI may not be usable as a biological marker on an individual basis. In clinical practice it is essential to\n",
      "\n",
      "\f",
      "know how a particular test result predicts the risk of a condition, i.e. does a particular person have the condition when he/she has\n",
      "a positive test result. Likelihood ratios are a unique approach to calculate the probability of the condition, while adapting for\n",
      "varying prior probabilities, i.e. the chance of having a condition at the outset. Positive Likelihood Ratio (PLR) is the ratio of the\n",
      "proportion of patients who have the target condition and test positive to the proportion of patients without the target condition\n",
      "who also test positive. Negative Likelihood Ratio (NLR) is the ratio of the proportion of patients who have the target condition who\n",
      "test negative to the proportion of patients without the target condition who also test negative. For example, a PLR > 10 may rule\n",
      "in diseases with a pre-test probability between 30% and 70%, i.e. when one is clinically uncertain. In comparison, a NLR of < 0.1\n",
      "may rule out diseases with this pre-test probability. These test characteristics can be easily used in a graphical interface, e.g. the\n",
      "Fagan Nomogram, such that the clinician can calculate the approximate probability of an individual having a pathological condition\n",
      "with a positive / negative test result. Unfortunately, we still do not know answers to some basic questions that we may hope to\n",
      "address using fMRI in individuals with psychiatric disorders. First, there is no general account of what brain processing may causally\n",
      "contribute to the establishing of anxiety disorders. For example, is there a universal mechanism that results in the development of\n",
      "psychiatric disorders, or is there a minimal set of processes that when they occur together produce clinically significant psychiatric\n",
      "problems? Second, we do not know the discriminative ability of fMRI, i.e. the degree to which differences in neural activation\n",
      "pattern can be related to different types of psychiatric disorders. Third, it is a wide open question whether neuroimaging can\n",
      "function as a test for individuals with psychiatric disorders. Imaging techniques have not contributed so far to improve diagnoses or\n",
      "treatment of psychiatric disorders. This is clearly the charge and challenge for the next decades.\n",

      "burnout amongst all physicians, since a previous survey performed in 2013 (1). Burnout in medicine can be detrimental to quality\n",
      "and safety of patient care, and can lead to job dissatisfaction, decreased productivity, high physician turnover, and ultimately can\n",
      "contribute to physician shortages and increasing health care costs (2). Another critical consequence of burnout in medicine is the\n",
      "impact on physician mental health, with studies showing burnout associated with increased depression, substance abuse, and\n",

      "PET is a non-invasive imaging technique that provides reproducible and fully-quantitative information on preselected\n",
      "metabolic/signaling pathways. PET is highly sensitive, thus, requiring only small amounts of biomarkers to be used for visualization\n",
      "and quantification purposes. By comparison to high-resolution anatomical images PET images appear blurred, which is attributed to\n",
      "the positron range effects and the limited detector size of the PET ring systems.Today, clinical PET imaging systems are offered\n",
      "almost exclusively in combination with CT and MR systems. Combined PET/MR, in particular, offers a number of intrinsic\n",
      "methodological advantages over PET only. These include, the use of MR imaging (e.g., by means of MR navigators) to estimate\n",
      "involuntary patient motion as a pre-requisite for motion compensation, and, thus, subsequent improvement of PET image quality\n",
      "and quantification. Following appropriate motion compensation, PET data can be improved in quality and accuracy through the use\n",

      "advances of PET instrumentation and data processing that help facilitate fully-integrated PET/MR in the first place, and draw a\n",

      "\n",
      "It is challenging to use decision-making AI machines in radiology situations that previously could only be done by humans. AI offers\n",
      "great promise but comes with numerous potential pitfalls, and is inevitably biased to some degree. Radiologists have a duty to\n",
      "understand the benefits and risks of AI agents they use, to alert patients and stakeholders to potential pitfalls as appropriate, and\n",
      "to monitor AI products to guard against harm. While this will undoubtedly mature into a reliable and robust infrastructure, currently\n",
      "we lack meaningful experience using such machines for patient care at scale. This gives rise to considerable potential for errors\n",
      "with high consequences.Because developing AI driven machines today requires massive amounts of well labeled radiology data, the\n",

      "Currently how to allow, manage, and contract for that data access is evolving at a rate which outstrips our current knowledge or\n",

      "obtain incredibly significant additional income by using these data in unethical ways which may harm patients, other cohorts, or the\n",
      "common good. Limiting radiology AI to ethical uses means leaving a massive amount of money on the table. One of our greatest\n",
      "challenges is how to thwart those who will attempt to acquire this value.Patients, radiologists, and other cohorts in the radiology\n",
      "community are at risk of being engulfed by digital surveillance and categorized and manipulated by intelligent and autonomous\n",
      "machines.AI has dramatically altered our perception of radiology examinations and associated data --- their value, how to use them\n",
      "and how they may be misused. As much as understanding AI, radiologists have a moral duty both to understand their data, and to\n",

      "The COVID pandemic that began in December 2019 has significantly affected all aspects of our day-to-day lives as radiologists,\n",
      "markedly reducing in-person conferences, side-by-side readouts, altered clinical schedules and rotations, caused postponements of\n",
      "certifying examinations, and delayed research activities. Teaching hospitals and radiology faculty have done a tremendous job in\n",
      "adapting to these highly unusual circumstances, turning to online or virtual platforms as novel teaching aids. Residency programs\n",
      "have primarily responded to the pandemic by transitioning to virtual teaching rounds, allowing residents to work from home, and\n",
      "conducting readouts virtually (73%). These platforms have their pros and cons. They are convenient and accessible, saving\n",
      "commuting time thereby increasing clinical productivity. Because the connections in these platforms are two way, interactive case\n",

      "Programs such as poll everywhere, RSNA Diagnosis Live and Kahoot enable active learning through audience participation and even\n",

      "cannot be emphasized enough, in which relationships develop and both parties engage not just with verbal communication and tone\n",

      "that it brings, and best of all, the option to read out in our pajamas. Fortunately, previous investigations have concluded that\n",
      "these platforms have not significantly resulted in an overall decline in trainee education and knowledge. However, the traditional\n",
      "side-by-side readout, central to radiology education, must not be totally abandoned, and should be progressively re-introduced,\n",

      "\n",
      "Within the first 6 hours of ischemic stroke onset, CT or MRI cannot detect histological changes indicating brain tissue infarction,\n",
      "because signs of tissue death are extremely subtle and hard to detect even with a microscope under experimental conditions. In\n",
      "this acute phase of ischemic stroke, the degree of regional ischemia triggers two types of tissue water content changes. Below a\n",
      "cerebral blood flow (CBF) of 30 ml/100gxmin the extracellular space shrinks and cells swell due to a shift of water molecules from\n",
      "the extracellular to the intracellular space (cellular edema). Diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) is highly sensitive to detect brain tissue\n",
      "with cellular edema and thus the pattern of brain tissue suffering from moderate to severe ischemia. Extended cellular edema\n",
      "predicts the development of space-occupying vasogenic edema with life-threatening mass effects (malignant edema). Pure cellular\n",
      "edema is not associated with net water uptake, thus does not affect the tissue's x-ray attenuation, and cannot be detected with\n",
      "CT. Ion depletion in the extracellular space triggers, however, net water uptake from capillaries with some rest-flow through special\n",
      "endothelium channels that can be blocked with low-dose glibenclamide. This edema type was called \"ionic\" and is observed in brain\n",
      "tissue with a CBF < 20 ml/100gxmin only, a threshold below which brain tissue cannot survive for more than 30 min. Ionic brain\n",
      "edema is thus a marker of irreversible ischemic injury. Because brain tissue water content correlates with tissue radiodensity, CT\n",

      "PURPOSE\n",
      "\n",
      "To investigate the clinical utility of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to detect clinically occult early breast cancer (EBC) including\n",
      "ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and to compare the performance of mammography, DWI, and dynamic contrast-enhanced breast\n",
      "MRI (DCE-MRI).\n",
      "\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "\n",
      "From June 2018 to January 2019, a total of 169 lesions with clinically occult EBC less than 2 cm who underwent preoperative breast\n",
      "MRI including DWI and mammography were retrospectively included in this study. Lesion conspicuity, size, type, detection rate,\n",
      "level of suspicion on each modality were evaluated and ADC and CNR on DWI were also obtained. Tumor histopathologic features on\n",

      "\n",
      "Double reading of screening mammography is standard of care in many countries. This approach is labour intensive and difficult to\n",

      "\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "\n",
      "3 Breast Screening Centres provided anonymised mammograms from Jan 2012-2019 for this IRB approved study. Each centre\n",
      "employed double reading with arbitration of discordant opinions by either a single third human reader or group of readers. The\n",
      "original human reading opinionsand outcomes at assessment for recalled cases with pathology were obtained from the National\n",
      "Breast Screening information system. The mammograms used in this study were a random sample from the entire data set which\n",
      "had not been used for algorithm development or training. The AI algorithms opinion (normal or cancer) was paired with the opinion\n",

      "\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "\n",
      "40,588 mammograms were reviewed. All were read by two human readers with 1,216/40,588 (3%) having a discordant opinion\n",
      "requiring arbitration. Overall 40,230 had a normal outcome and 358 were biopsy proven cancers. The overall recall rate was 4%,\n",
      "with a cancer detection rate of 8.5 per 1000. When the AI algorithm was applied as the second reader to this test set, there was\n",
      "consensus in 33,255 (81.9% ) of the reads to either recall or not recall the cases. This meant that 7,333 (18.1%) of reads were\n",

      "A new deep learning (DL) algorithm was designed to predict a patient's risk of developing breast cancer at multiple time points using\n",

      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "\n",
      "The DL risk assessment model was developed using consecutive bilateral screening mammograms from 80818 patients between 2009\n",
      "to 2016. Mammograms were randomly assigned to training, validation, or testing, resulting in 210819 examinations in 56831\n",

      "PURPOSE\n",
      "\n",
      "To determine the effect of breast density on the performance of a globally-aware multiple instance classifier to predict malignancy\n",
      "on screening mammography.\n",
      "\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "\n",
      "In this retrospective study, we trained a globally-aware multiple instance classifier (GMIC) on over 200,000 digital screening\n",
      "mammograms performed at our institution from 2010-2017. The GMIC is a neural network model that aggregates both global and\n",
      "local information to make predictions of malignancy for each breast of a screening mammogram. The breast density was determined\n",
      "by the original interpreting radiologist using the BI-RADS classification for breast density. The reference standard for determining\n",
      "the presence of malignancy was the pathology reports. Once the model was trained, a non-enriched reader study was performed to\n",
      "compare the performance of the model to 14 radiologists. Each reader independently provided probability estimates of malignancy\n",
      "for each breast in 720 screening exams (1,440 breasts). Among the 1,440 breasts, 61 breasts were associated with biopsy-proven\n",
      "malignant findings, 30 in non-dense breasts and 31 in dense breasts. Performance of the model and the radiologists was assessed\n",
      "using area under the ROC curve (AUC) analysis. The ability of the model and the radiologists to detect biopsy-proven malignancy\n",
      "was compared using the Fisher's Exact Test.\n",
      "\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "\n",
      "The model achieved an overall AUC of 0.925, performing better in non-dense breasts than dense breasts (AUC 0.941 vs AUC\n",
      "0.908). In the reader study, the model achieved an AUC of 0.897 (non-dense: 0.908, dense: 0.885) while the average of\n",
      "radiologists achieved an AUC of 0.895 (non-dense: 0.935, dense: 0.856). Both the model and average of radiologists correctly\n",
      "identified 28/30 (93.3%) malignancies in non-dense breasts. The model identified 29/31 (93.5%) and the average of radiologists\n",

      "PURPOSE\n",
      "\n",
      "Breast cancer molecular subtypes are very important for choosing the optimal treatments. In this study we applied deep learning to\n",
      "predict subtypes based on ER, PR and HER2. A conventional convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent CNN using\n",
      "convolutional long short term memory (CLSTM) were used to compare their performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "\n",
      "A total of 244 patients were analyzed, 99 in training dataset scanned on a Siemens 1.5T system. The independent testing dataset\n",
      "was collected from a different hospital with a total of 145 patients, scanned on a GE 3T system. Patients were classified into 3\n",
      "subtypes based on hormonal receptor (HR) and HER2 receptor: (HR+/HER2-), HER2+ and triple negative (TN). Only DCE images were\n",
      "used. The smallest bounding box covering tumor ROI was used as the input for deep learning to develop the first model in the\n",
      "Training dataset. Then, transfer learning was applied to re-tune the model for the testing dataset, by splitting it based on the time\n",
      "of MRI into 83 patients in Testing-1 and 62 patients in Testing-2.\n",
      "\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "\n",
      "In the training dataset, the mean accuracy was higher by using CLSTM (0.91) than CNN (0.79). When the developed model was\n",
      "applied to the independent testing datasets, the accuracy was only 0.4-0.5, suggesting that the developed model cannot be\n",
      "directly applied. With transfer learning by re-tuning parameters using one part of the testing dataset (Testing-1), the mean\n",
      "accuracy reached 0.91 by CNN and 0.83 by CLSTM. The re-trained model improved accuracy in the other part of the testing\n",
      "dataset (Testing-2) from 0.47 to 0.78 by CNN, and from 0.39 to 0.74 by CLSTM. Overall, transfer learning could improve the\n",
      "classification accuracy by greater than 30%. When the re-tuning was performed using Testing-2 and evaluated in Testing-1, the\n",
      "results were similar, supporting the robustness of the transfer learning approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "\n",
      "The recurrent network using CLSTM could track changes in signal intensity during DCE acquisition, and achieved a higher accuracy\n",

      "A consecutive sample of 17886 screening digital mammograms with 114 biopsy-proven cancers was retrospectively collected.\n",
      "Exams were acquired with Siemens and Hologic DM systems in one screening unit that invites women for biennial screening and uses\n",
      "independent double reading of mammograms. An AI system (Transpara version 1.6.0, ScreenPoint Medical) automatically analyzed\n",

      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "\n",
      "All patients with an indication for Spectral CT-coronary angiography (SCCTA) were administered 50ml of iodine containing contrast\n",

      "Hounsfield Units (HU) as well as iodine content (mg/ml) in each detectable non-calcified plaque were determined. In patients with\n",

      "\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "\n",
      "In 68 patients 50 non-calcified plaques were detected by SCCTA. Mean density was 70 ± 56 HU. Mean Iodine uptake was 2.4 ±\n",

      "\n",
      "Subclinical hypothyroidism(SCH) has recently been acknowledged as an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease\n",
      "(CAD).However, there are few studies about the characteristics of CAD in SCH patients. The aim of the study is to evaluate the\n",
      "features of CAD in SCH patients using coronary artery CT angiography (CTA).\n",
      "\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "\n",
      "From 1 April 2018 to 28 February 2020,206 consecutive patients(104 men,102 women; mean age, 71.2 ± 9.9 years) with SCH were\n",
      "found coronary plaques on coronary CTA. Different grades of SCH were defined by serum TSH level. The distribution and types of\n",
      "plaques, luminal narrowing, segment involvement scores (SIS), segment stenosis scores (SSS)were evaluated and compared\n",
      "between different grades of SCH and different sexes.\n",
      "\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "\n",
      "Patients with grade3 SCH have less calcified plaques than grade1 SCH(0.7±0.9 vs 1.9±1.8,p=0.001),and more non-calcified\n",
      "plaques(0.8±1.0 vs 0.4±0.8,p=0.002). As the condition of SCH aggravated, the proportion of non-calcified plaques in total plaques\n",
      "increased(9.3% vs 14.7% vs 27.5%, all p<0.001). The grade3 SCH has less minimal stenosis and more mild stenosis than other\n",
      "grades SCH(p<0.05), while SIS and SSS between different grades of SCH have no significant discrepancies(p>0.05). Multivariate\n",
      "logistic regression analysis demonstrated that TSH>10mU/L(OR: 8.11; 95% CI 2.89-22.75, p<0.001) and current smoking(OR: 2.77;\n",
      "95% CI 1.02-7.52, p=0.045) were independent risk factors for the prevalence of non-calcified plaques. In different sexes groups,\n",

      "\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "\n",
      "High serum TSH level is associated with the incidence of non-calcified plaques in CAD patients with SCH. This may be the cause of\n",

      "\n",
      "An early diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) is crucial but is challenging for resource-poor countries with a shortage of radiologists. An\n",
      "approach to solve this obstacle is to take photographs on chest X-ray (CXR) and interpret them using smartphones. We developed\n",

      "\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "\n",
      "Three publicly available datasets, MIMIC-CXR, Montgomery, and Shenzhen were used for model pretraining, transferring, and\n",
      "evaluation, respectively. The 121-layer neural network was pretrained on MIMIC-CXR database containing 250,044 CXRs with 14\n",
      "pulmonary labels, which did not include TB. The model was then recalibrated for CXR photographs by using simulation methods to\n",
      "augment the dataset. Finally, the TBShoNet was built by connecting the pretrained model to an additional 2-layer neural network\n",
      "trained on augmented CXR images in Montgomery dataset (TB: 58; normal: 80). The photographs taken by five different phones\n",
      "from the CXRs in Shenzhen dataset (TB: 336; normal: 326) were used to test the model performance. Diagnostic performance was\n",
      "measured using area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for image-wise classification.\n",
      "\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "\n",
      "TBShoNet demonstrated an AUC of 0.89 (confidence interval: 0.87-0.91) for TB detection. With optimal cutoff, sensitivity and\n",

      "\n",
      "Chest CT is an accurate tool for assessment and monitoring the pulmonary status of hospitalized patients with COVID-19\n",
      "associated lung disease. Artificial Intelligence (AI) deep learning has the potential to aid in automated and standardized evaluation\n",
      "of CT scans. This work aims to investigate the potential of 3D deep learning method to predict clinical outcomes of patients with\n",
      "COVID-19, based on chest CT.\n",
      "\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "\n",
      "632 chest CTs in patients with PCR-proven COVID-19 were correlated with the clinical outcome of admission to an ICU (N=69) or no\n",
      "admission to an ICU (N=563). An automated whole lung segmentation algorithm was developed and used to localize whole lung.\n",
      "Based on the local region-of-interest around the lung (a bounding box), a 3D deep learning-based algorithm for classification of\n",
      "clinical outcome labels were trained with 5-fold cross validation. Model performance for classification on chest CT was evaluated by\n",

      "RESULTS\n",
      "\n",
      "Classification models achieved overall accuracy of 92%, sensitivity 73%, and specificity 93.9%, despite an imbalanced dataset\n",
      "weighted towards no ICU admission. The positive predictive value for predicting ICU admission was only 53%, but the negative\n",
      "predictive value was 97%. Such a model might alert the clinician to the enhanced potential of ICU admission, when combined with\n",

      "PURPOSE\n",
      "\n",
      "The majority of studies on automated lung nodule malignancy prediction utilize subjective labels provided by radiologists instead of\n",
      "using a histopathological reference standard. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of a deep learning system\n",
      "that was trained using subjective labels from LIDC-IDRI by testing it on two independent datasets of nodules from the Danish Lung\n",
      "Cancer Screening Trial (DLCST) with histopathological proof or follow-up over a period of at least 2 years, and comparing\n",
      "performance with a panel of 11 clinicians and the clinically established Brock risk model.\n",
      "\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "\n",
      "We considered nodules annotated by at least 3 out of 4 radiologists from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. The malignancy ratings were\n",
      "averaged and indeterminate nodules were excluded resulting in 680 nodules (352 benign and 328 malignant) for development. We\n",
      "trained a deep learning system based on 2D multi-view CNN and 3D extension of VGGNet on the development set. We tested the\n",
      "system on two sets of nodules from DLCST. The first set, dataset A, consisted of 62 cancers and 120 random benign nodules and\n",
      "the second set, dataset B, consisted of the same 62 cancers and a size-matched group of 118 benign nodules. A group of 11\n",
      "clinicians, consisting of 4 radiologists, 5 radiology residents, and 2 pulmonologists, were tasked with grading the nodules on a\n",
      "continuous scale from 0 to 100. Finally, the Brock risk model was also applied to all nodules.\n",
      "\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "\n",
      "On dataset A, the deep learning system produced an AUC of 0.941, which is better than the average clinician (0.892, p = 0.02) and\n",
      "comparable to the Brock model (0.924, p = 0.35). On dataset B, the system produced an AUC of 0.737, which is comparable to the\n",

      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "\n",
      "The deep learning system trained with subjective labels performed comparably with humans and the Brock model but showed\n",

      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "\n",
      "This HIPAA-compliant study was approved by IRB. Medical records of patients diagnosed with stage II/III (T3/4, any N, M0) rectal\n",
      "cancer who received short- or long-course neoadjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy were reviewed. Short-course radiotherapy was\n",
      "defined as 25Gy given over a week before surgery. Long-course (chemo)radiotherapy was defined as 50.4-54Gy given over 5-6\n",
      "weeks before surgery. MRI-based tumor regression grade (mrTRG), mrTNM stage, and other imaging features were assessed by a\n",

      "\n",
      "A total of 12 rats were divided into the normal group, moderate and severe hepatic steaotosis group (3,6,3 rats relatively)\n",
      "according to TG mass-fraction of 4.43%, 14.03%and 27.83%(the quantifications of TG were acquired by using a colorimetric assay\n",

      "magnetic resonance system with mDixcon-quant sequence and eight channel animal coil. After the CT scan, reconstructed imaging\n",
      "data were processed by using MMD soft-ware currently not commercially available. MMD-derrived fat volume fraction (MMD-FVF)\n",
      "and PDFF-based fat fraction (PDFF) were measured. Reference values of FVF were determined by the quantification of Triglyceride\n",

      "\n",
      "The TG mass-fraction of this study can be used to simulate the fat content of normal to severe hepatic steatosis in human liver.\n",
      "Both algorithms showed good linear relationship between the measured fat fraction and actual TG fraction. MMD algorithm revealed\n",
      "a linear correlation equation of y=0.925x+3.986(r² = 0.965, P=0.000). For PDFF, the linear correlation equation was y=0.924x-\n",

      "\n",
      "Dual-energy CT (DECT)-derived iodine quantification has been investigated for lesion characterization and response assessment,\n",
      "yet data on reproducibility of such measurements is scarce. Our aim was to investigate reproducibility of iodine measurements in\n",
      "patients who underwent two repetitive DECT examinations either on a dual-source (dsDECT), a rapid kV switching (rsDECT) or a\n",
      "dual-layer detector scanner (dlDECT).\n",
      "\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "\n",
      "We retrospectively included 133 patients who underwent two repetitive, portal-venous phase abdominal DECT examinations. 48\n",
      "patients were repetitively scanned on dsDECT, 45 on rsDECT and 41 on dlDECT. The groups were matched for body weight, age,\n",
      "sex and average inter-scan differences in contrast media and saline chaser amount as well as flow rate. Three readers measured\n",
      "iodine concentration in iodine maps and HU in virtual monoenergetic images (VMI) at 65 keV as grey-scale reference; regions of\n",
      "interest (ROIs) were placed in the left/right liver lobe, upper/lower spleen, left/right renal cortex, abdominal aorta and portal vein.\n",
      "\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "\n",
      "Averaged over all ROIs, absolute difference in iodine between two repetitive scans was 0.60±0.63, 0.78±0.83 and 0.85±0.83 mg/ml\n",
      "for rsDECT, dlDECT and dsDECT, respectively; the corresponding HU differences in VMI65keV were 18.0±19.0, 24.1±26.6, 20.1±32.8\n",

      "dlDECT (10.3 (4.4-20.4)%) and dsDECT 10.9 (5.6-37.4) %). For liver and spleen, differences were more pronounced (rsDECT:10.6\n",
      "(5.1-18.7) %, dlDECT: 14.8 (6.9-31.0)%, dsDECT:0.23 (9.9-59.0)%. Normalizing the iodine uptake of the liver/spleen to the portal\n",
      "vein/aorta did not reduce longitudinal variability in any of the included scanners (p-range: 0.49-0.55).\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "\n",
      "Iodine quantification in DECT is subject to intra-individual, longitudinal variability which should be acknowledged when aiming to use\n",

      "\n",
      "This single-center, retrospective HIPAA-compliant study included 17 patients (11 men, 6 women; mean age, 57 years) with\n",
      "pathology-proven Merkel cell carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, or melanoma. All patients underwent contrast-enhanced DECT exams\n",
      "at baseline (BL) and after initiation of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. At least one exam after treatment initiation (FU1) was\n",
      "available. Target lesions were selected and assessed based on RECIST 1.1 criteria for BL, FU1 and final follow-up (FFU), defined as\n",
      "the most recent exam while on therapy. DECT-based iodine concentration values were obtained for all target lesions and\n",
      "subsequently normalized to iodine in the abdominal aorta (NIC). Tumor percent changes in NIC between BL and FU1 were\n",
      "calculated. Lesions were categorized at FFU as progressive disease (PD), stable disease (SD) or partial response (PR). Analysis of\n",

      "\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "\n",
      "Thirty-one lesions were assessed at BL and FU1 with an average of 141 days between scans. At FU1, mean NIC increased 34% in\n",

      "\n",
      "Despite increased treatment of incidental renal masses, cancer-specific mortality has not decreased. Thus, distinction of\n",
      "benign/indolent tumors that can be monitored from clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common and aggressive form\n",

      "\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",

      "\n",
      "The importance of written patient communication comprehension has increased as many patients are choosing to take a more\n",
      "active role in their health care. In the setting of an abnormal screening mammogram, the Mammography Quality Standards Act\n",
      "(MQSA) mandates that patients receive a mailed \"recall\" lay letter informing them to return for additional follow-up imaging. MQSA\n",
      "states that the language used in this letter should be \"easily understood by a lay person.\" The Centers for Disease Control and\n",
      "Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommend that all written patient communication should have\n",
      "between a 6th and 8th grade reading level. On February 15, 2019, our institution revised the language of our recall lay letter to the\n",
      "appropriate 6th grade reading level from a 12th grade reading level. This was implemented across all four of our institution's\n",
      "outpatient breast imaging sites. We hypothesize that the lack of readability of our previous recall lay letter may have led to patient\n",

      "Lesion RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) measurement and segmentation from computed tomography (CT)\n",
      "scans are important tasks in oncology image analysis for assessing disease progression and therapy response. Manual lesion\n",
      "measurement and segmentation are tedious, time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. To reduce this manual burden\n",
      "and inconsistency, we propose a unified framework (\"SEANet\") for automatic and joint lesion SEgmentation and RECIST Annotation\n",
      "on a variety of lesion types throughout the body with only one click guidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "\n",
      "SEANet has two main parts performed by two convolutional neural networks. The first part extracts the lesion of interest with one-\n",

      "RESULTS\n",
      "\n",
      "For RECIST annotation, the long and short axis diameter differences of SEANet compared to the manual reference standard were\n",

      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "One challenge in translating deep learning models to the clinic is a lack of generalizability across institutions, due to poor availability\n",
      "of multi-institutional datasets. The creation of such datasets is often limited by data governance limitations as well as patient\n",

      "\n",
      "Using imaging-based approaches to determine TSS may identify a new population of patients eligible for stroke treatments. Our\n",
      "analysis represents a robust approach for evaluating multiple automated and radiologist-dependent methods on a single dataset.\n",
      "Moreover, the significantly higher sensitivity of the DL model means that this approach could increase the number of patients\n",

      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Stroke is the fifth-leading cause of death in the United States. Interventions that focus on reperfusion of ischemic areas, i.e.\n",
      "thrombolysis, are only available to patients with a known time since stroke (TSS) up to 4.5 hours, but up to 27% of patients are\n",
      "ineligible due to unknown TSS. Research has sought to estimate TSS using imaging. Radiologists use diffusion-weighted imaging\n",
      "(DWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) to assess signal mismatching regions representing ischemic, not yet\n",

      "Using diffusion MRI from 411 patients, we evaluate our deep learning (DL) model, a slicewise convolutional network, to classify TSS\n",

      "\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "\n",
      "Abdominal NCCT images were retrospectively archived from February 2018 to April 2019 for three parts: a dataset for kidney and\n",

      "\n",
      "The Dual-AI Platform detects unreported pulmonary nodules while markedly reducing the number of alerts provided by a comparable\n",

      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Pulmonary nodules may be precursors to malignancy and are routinely missed on computed tomography (CT). Computer-aided\n",

      "\n",
      "Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "The Dual-AI Platform was applied retrospectively to 5,047 chest CTs and their corresponding reports. The CV algorithm detected\n",

      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "\n",
      "Increasingly patients have direct access to radiologist reports. These reports are not designed for the patient audience and can\n",

      "Background\n",
      "\n",
      "Lack of comprehension of medical image reporting jargon (both semantics and syntax) is a critical barrier to patient understanding\n",
      "and engagement in their own care. This lack of clarity may inadvertently give patients an incorrect impression of their findings or\n",
      "diagnosis, and creates risk due to the communication gap between patients and radiologists. This may also contribute to loss of\n",
      "satisfying patient-physician relationships which is reported to be a source of job alienation and burnout for radiologists. We present\n",
      "the utilization of NLG technology as a first step to reconcile this problem while being cognizant of real-world constraints and\n",

      "PURPOSE\n",
      "\n",
      "The dose to the lens of the patient's eyes varies for each projection view during fluoroscopically-guided neuro-interventional\n",
      "procedures. An estimation of lens dose can be obtained using Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation for each exposure projection but MC\n",
      "cannot provide real-time feedback to the interventionalist. To obtain real-time update, deep learning (DL) models were investigated\n",
      "as a means to estimate the patient lens dose for the given exposure conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "\n",
      "Monte Carlo simulations were done using a Zubal computational phantom to produce a dataset of eye lens dose values that was\n",
      "used to train various DL models. The simulations were performed with variation of six geometric parameters: entrance field size, LAO\n",
      "gantry angulation, patient x, y, z head position relative to the beam isocenter, and whether right or left eye. The dose for each\n",
      "combination of parameters was expressed as lens dose per entrance air kerma (mGy/Gy)). Portions of the dataset were used for\n",
      "testing and the rest were used for validation and training of the models. Model performance was evaluated using the metrics of\n",
      "mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).\n",

      "RESULTS\n",
      "\n",
      "Several different DL models were tested using various configurations of dense layers, activation functions and other factors. The\n",
      "best model found was a combination of eLU models derived from k-fold cross validation methods. The combined model has each k-\n",
      "fold model make a prediction, and then takes the median of their predictions to generate one final prediction. Using this combined\n",
      "model method led to lower overall error (MAPE < 8%) and more accurate predictions compared to a single model. Furthermore,\n",
      "prediction time for the combined model was about 30 ms, while MC simulation time was in the range of hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "\n",
      "A DL model is able to accurately infer the lens dose for a set of given geometric exposure parameters. This work shows that deep\n",
      "learning is a viable option for lens dose estimation for fluoroscopically-guided neuro-interventional procedures and could eliminate\n",

      "Up-regulation of tumor PD-L1 expression can lead to a poor prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The clinical outcome of\n",

      "ZTE sequences of the knee were acquired in 100 consecutive patients (44 Female, 56 Male) using a 3T scanner in conjunction with\n",
      "standard MRI protocols. The average patient age was 40 years [13, 68] with an average BMI of 26.3kg/m2 [18.2, 41.5]. Clinical\n",
      "indications included pain (n=35), suspected internal derangement of knee (n=28), trauma (n=23), and evaluation of post-operative\n",

      "Retrospective search for consecutive patients with knee MRI following an MPFL reconstruction between 1/1/2010 and 6/1/2019\n",
      "yielded 41 patients. Exclusion criteria included patients requiring revision MPFL surgery for reasons other than instability (n=3)\n",
      "yielding a study group of 38 patients (22F:16M, mean 20.9 ± 8 years old, range 9-42).Two MSK radiologists assessed in consensus:\n",

      "The anatomic femoral origin of the MPFL is between the adductor tubercle (AT), medial epicondyle (ME), and medial gastrocnemius\n",

      "The training dataset consisted of 165 MR scans with a 3D fast spin-echo (FSE) Dixon proton-density sequence. Thick-slice image\n",
      "with 3 mm slice thickness was reconstructed from the original image of 1 mm slice thickness with a downsampling factor of 3, and\n",
      "the convolutional neural network was trained to develop thin-slice images from the thick-slice images using these image pairs. Cubic\n",

      "PURPOSE\n",
      "\n",
      "Instabilities of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) are clinically indistinct and require selective testing by DRUJ arthroscopy and a hook\n",
      "test of the foveal attachment of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). We investigated if avulsion of the foveal attachment\n",
      "(Atzei 3) and the volar and dorsal stabilizing ligaments of the TFCC can be sufficiently diagnosed on MR arthrography (MRA) to\n",
      "predict instability of the DRUJ.\n",
      "\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "\n",
      "In this retrospective monocenter study 37 patients with ulnar sided wrist pain (instability group; mean age 38.6 ±11.2 years; 13\n",
      "female; 24 male) underwent arthroscopy with a positive hook test and 3T MRA between 2013 and 2019. Twelve patients with\n",
      "negative hook test and 37 patients without ulnar sided wrist pain comprised the control group. Two fellowship-trained\n",
      "musculoskeletal radiologists independently evaluated all MRA in a random distribution and blinded to clinical and surgical data as\n",
      "follows: foveal TFCC attachment, dorsal and volar radioulnar ligament (intact, scaring, partial/full avulsion). A 15-point score with\n",
      "ligament integrity results was created to calculate sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Height-to-length ratio (HLR) of the TFCC\n",
      "was measured. ANOVA was calculating for HLR differences between groups (p<0.05). Interrater agreement was calculated\n",
      "(weighted kappa, κ).\n",
      "\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "\n",
      "Partial avulsion of the foveal TFCC was evident in 30% (11/37), full avulsion in 62% (23/37). Additional foveal scaring was detected\n",
      "in 30% (11/37). Dorsal radioulnar ligament tears were detected in 70% (16/37 partial avulsion, 10/37 full avulsion) and volar\n",
      "ligament tears in 49% (11/37 partial avulsion, 7/37 full avulsion). A positive hook test could be predicted with a score of at least 5\n",
      "of 15 points with a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 76%, 100% and 89%, respectively. HLR did not reveal significant\n",
      "differences between groups (p=0.486). Interrater agreement was excellent for HLR (ICC, 0.92), good for foveal insertion (κ, 0.72)\n",

      "\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "\n",
      "Foveal avulsions of the TFCC can be accurately detected using MRA. Presence of additional volar and dorsal ligament tears\n",

      "70 to 83% for other guidelines. We hypothesized that the difference would be even greater if the BRR was assessed for all nodules\n",
      "detected on ultrasound. This study aimed to compare the ACR TI-RADS biopsy recommendation rate with other guidelines for\n",
      "nodules reported on diagnostic thyroid ultrasound.\n",
      "\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "\n",
      "7 radiology practices prospectively submitted thyroid ultrasound reports to the ACR TI-RADS registry between October 2018 and\n",
      "March 2020 for low-risk patients undergoing routine thyroid sonography. Data were collected using a structured reporting template\n",

      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "\n",
      "A total of 111 patients with suspected SIH were retrospectively reviewed and divided into two groups according to spinal imaging;\n",
      "with spinal longitudinal extrathecal CSF collection (SLEC) group (SLEC +), and without SLEC group (SLEC -). Twenty non-SIH\n",

      "Of the 111 SIH patients 71 (64%) presented with an SLEC and 40 (36%) without. The adjusted renal pelvis density was\n",

      "spinal nerve root diverticulum. Alternative pathomechanisms like the CSF venous fistula, may also be demonstrated on imaging. But\n",
      "there are still patients with the classic appearance of SIH, clinically and in imaging, where neither one of these two entities could\n",

      "\n",
      "Radiologic procedures are recommended based on benefit-to-risk justification. In X-ray imaging, while the benefit is often immediate\n",

      "\n",
      "\f",
      "imaging utilization, particularly during a spreading pandemic like COVID-19 in which fast and accurate diagnostic tools are highly\n",
      "needed. Chest CT and chest radiography (CXR) have shown promising results in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19,\n",

      "\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",

      "The analysis was performed in terms of mortality rate per age group. COVID-19 mortality was extracted from epidemiological data\n",
      "across 159,107 patients in Italy. For radiological risk, the study considered 659 Chest CT scans performed in adult patients. Organ\n",

      "\n",
      "Coronavirus disease-2019(COVID-19) is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation, which caused a large global outbreak. There have\n",

      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "\n",
      "By doubling the tube current with the same tube voltage, adequate diagnostic image quality of chest radiography was achieved\n",
      "when scanning through glass. The patient dose roughly stays unchanged due to glass attenuation of low energy x-rays. Radiation\n",
      "exposure due to x-ray scatter is generally well under regulatory limits in these non-standard imaging conditions.\n",

      "\n",
      "In response to a patient surge during the COVID-19 pandemic, portable x-ray equipment is used for imaging through the glass of ED\n",
      "isolation rooms or in outdoor triage tent areas. To maintain diagnostic image quality and radiation safety for patients and hospital\n",
      "staff in these conditions, we performed phantom evaluations for quantitative evaluation of image quality and exposure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Evaluation\n",
      "\n",
      "An anthropomorphic chest phantom was used for chest x-ray through a sliding glass door (Fig 1a). The entrance air kerma and\n",
      "beam half-value layer was measured and the Exposure Index (EI) was recorded. Acquisitions were performed with the glass door\n",
      "open (standard) and closed (through-glass) using routine techniques. The mAs was increased for the through-glass scan to match\n",
      "the EI of the standard scan for the anthropomorphic and an image quality phantom (IQP) to obtain contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR).\n",
      "Patient effective dose estimates were calculated via Monte Carlo (PCMXC20). A radiation scatter survey was performed to evaluate\n",
      "staff safety (Fig 1b).To facilitate patient triage and reduce potential exposure, tents were set up in a dedicated area of an outdoor\n",
      "parking lotand portable x-ray units were used to scan patients in one tent (Fig 1c). A radiation scatter survey was performed in\n",

      "\n",
      "Discussion\n",
      "\n",
      "The glass door attenuated 50% attenuation of x-ray flux. The EI for the chest phantom and CNR of the IQP was matched by\n",
      "increasing tube current by 50% through glass and this reduced the patient effective dose was 20%. However, in the later trial of\n",

      "\n",
      "Computed tomography (CT) of COVID-19 shows a relatively global effect through the whole lungs, mimicking many other lung\n",

      "presents a novel method to relieve the difficulties.\n",
      "\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "\n",
      "The method aims to reduce the global effect through the 3D whole lung volume into 2D domain, where the anatomic land-markers\n",
      "along the z-axis, denoted as Lung Marks are used to eliminate axial variable so that the cross section at each z location has similar\n",
      "texture patterns for normal subjects. Our experiments indicated that 30 Lung Marks are sufficient to eliminate the axial variable.\n",
      "The method computes texture measures from each 2D cross section and maps the measures on to the corresponding Lung Mark,\n",
      "resulting in a profile along the z-axis. The difference of the profiles between two different abnormalities is the proposed sensitive\n",

      "\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "\n",
      "To show the effectiveness of the proposed sensitive merit, 48 COVID-19 cases and 48 normal screening cases were used. Firstly,\n",
      "the lungs of each of the 96 cases were segmented, and the segmented whole lungs were labeled/registered to the 30 Lung Marks\n",
      "along the axial direction. Texture measures (traditional Haralick features) were computed from each axial cross image at the\n",
      "corresponding Lung Mark along the z-axis to generate the profiles of the proposed sensitive merit. A skew U shape distribution was\n",
      "observed in the vector distance of the texture measure between the normal and COVID-19 subjects. Individual Haralick features\n",

      "PURPOSE\n",
      "\n",
      "The purpose of this study is to develop a convolutional-neural-network (CNN) CT noise reduction framework that utilizes a widely\n",
      "accessible natural (optical) image database. For training, CNN denoising algorithms often use CT projection data and noise insertion\n",
      "to synthesize CT images at different dose (noise) levels. However, limited access to projection data makes it difficult to implement\n",
      "this approach. Here we describe a training framework that uses a public natural image database and does not require projection\n",
      "data access.\n",
      "\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "\n",
      "The denoising framework uses transfer learning; noise realizations from repeated phantom CT scans are superimposed onto natural\n",
      "images to mimic CT images at different dose levels. ImageNet was used for this task because of its diverse feature space, high\n",
      "resolution, and low noise. Patches were extracted from ImageNet and scaled to match the Hounsfield unit range of CT images. Prior\n",
      "to each training epoch, noise patches were shuffled and added to natural images. The CNN was trained to remove the\n",
      "superimposed CT noise and restore the underlying natural image. A residual architecture was used containing 18 convolutional\n",
      "layers, each with 128 features, and a mean-squared-error loss function. The technique was tested on 150-micron resolution\n",
      "thoracic CT images acquired from 5 patients on a research photon-counting-detector (PCD) CT scanner. Noise and edge sharpness\n",
      "were visually assessed, noise was measured in the aorta and sharpness quantified using line profiles.\n",
      "\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "\n",
      "The CNN reduced noise by 74.2 ± 0.2 % compared to images created using filtered back projection and a sharp reconstruction\n",
      "kernel. Visual and line profile assessments demonstrated that fine anatomic details were preserved in the denoised images. In the\n",
      "shoulder, the sharp boundary of cortical bone was well maintained and noise reduction in the trabecular bone regions improved\n",
      "delineation of fine structures. Similar improvements were observed in lung images.\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "\n",
      "The developed CNN denoising framework provides extensive noise reduction while maintaining fine anatomic features. Because this\n",

      "\n",
      "While Bayesian theory has shown great potential for count-limited medical image reconstruction in the past two decades, its wide\n",

      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "\n",
      "By formulating the two basic terms of data fidelity and prior expectation in Bayesian theory as probability distribution functions, ß\n",
      "becomes the ratio of the data uncertainty (or variance a) and the prior tolerance (or σ). By considering the tissue-specific textures\n",
      "in the to-be-reconstructed image as the figure of merit for medical diagnosis, two look-up tables were constructed to guide a\n",
      "steadily cooling down of the tissue texture patterns to ensure an acceptable image, mimicking the physical model of cooling down\n",
      "the temperature steadily for a high quality crystal. One look-up table is constructed as a-ß table, where σ is treated as the\n",

      "\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "\n",
      "MRN was tested in 3 pigs. An injector delivered 220µm MDEB aggregates through a catheter balloon positioned in the proper hepatic\n",
      "artery. The magnetic force from the MRI gradient and the gravitational forces were used in combination to steer aggregates to the\n",
      "segmental artery feeding the tumor. Beforehand, a segmentation of the arterial tree from DSA/CTA data was performed to\n",
      "determine the optimal animal position to optimize gravitational force and plan the timing and orientation of steering gradients. The\n",
      "segmentation was co-registered with MR-angiography. The aggregate was tracked with a True-FISP before the MRN steering\n",
      "sequence, and its location after embolization was determined with T1 VIBE. The flow was controlled by partial inflation of the\n",
      "balloon catheter and measured using 2D cine-phase sequence. Finally, we simulated in 19 patients with a total of 32 nodules of\n",

      "\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "\n",
      "After MRN in the pigs, 82% of the aggregates reached the targeted left medial lobe (Fig 1-1). Without MRN, 95% of the aggregates\n",
      "were heading into the right lobe (Fig 1-2). We could localize MDEB aggregate in the target segmental artery and release of MDEB in\n",
      "the target segment after removing the pig from the B0 field (Fig 1-5). The controlled flow dropped the velocity from 35 cm/s to 15\n",
      "cm/s at systole and from 10 cm/s to 5 cm/s at diastole. Partial inflation of the balloon created a slow pulsatile flow propelling\n",

      "RFA treatment was administered to preclinical murine cancer models that followed up with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n",

      "PURPOSE\n",
      "\n",
      "Pre-treatment pulmonary nodule localization techniques can reduce conversion of minimally invasive surgical resection to open\n",
      "thoracotomy and can aid radiation planning. However, there are no outcomes reported after CT-guided fiducial localization. The\n",
      "purpose of this study is to assess the technical success rate of CT-guided fiducial localization of pulmonary nodules, surgical\n",
      "localization failure rate, and recurrence-free survival.\n",
      "\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "\n",
      "A single-center, retrospective study was performed on consecutive CT-guided fiducial localization of lung nodules. Endpoints\n",
      "included technical success of fiducial placement, surgical localization failure rate, and 1-year and 2-year recurrence-free survival.\n",
      "\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "\n",
      "136 CT-guided fiducial localization procedures were performed on 128 patients (66% female; mean age, 64 years +/- 12) for 141\n",
      "nodules (mean size, 11 mm +/- 5; mean distance to pleura, 10 mm +/- 8). The technical success rate was 98% (133/136). 134\n",
      "nodules were resected during 126 operations performed 6 days +/- 16 after fiducial placement (range, 0-123). Surgical localization\n",
      "failure occurred in one case. Seventy-four of 133 resected nodules were invasive primary lung cancers, 16 were minimally invasive\n",
      "carcinoma, 7 were adenocarcinoma in-situ. Seventeen nodules were metastases, 1 was a carcinoid and 18 were benign. Among 46\n",
      "patients who underwent a wedge resection of a primary lung cancer with at least 1 year of CT surveillance, and 34 patients with at\n",
      "least 2 years of CT surveillance, there was no evidence of local recurrence or intra- or extra-thoracic metastasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "\n",
      "CT-guided fiducial localization of pulmonary nodules is safe, effective and results in a low surgical localization failure rate. One and\n",

      "ABSTRACT\n",
      "\n",
      "Anomalies of the Corpus callosum may be associated with with favorable or unfavorable neuropsychological outcome. An important\n",
      "role for fetal MRI has become to predict the prognosis in these cases as accurate as possible. There, the most important\n",
      "information is to decide whether the complete or partial agenesis of the Corpus callosum is combined with other brain anomalies,\n",
      "such as, for instance, disorders of cortical development or pontocerebellar malformations. Patterns that are possibly based on a\n",
      "chromosomal defect may be recognozed. In addition, even in isolated Callosal agenesis morphological landmarks have been defined\n",
      "that may indiate a more or less favorable prognosis in a respective case. This was done by a correlation of these landmarks with\n",
      "postnatal neuropsychological tests. Thus MRI has become an important prenatal imaging tool, improving the management of\n",

Consequently, breast cancer awarness has rapidly increased\\nsince then. This awarness is, though, still very much heterogenous in the population. The capital city, Vienna, is multicultural, with\\nmany people coming from middle-east countries; as a consequence, breast radiologists are faced with a wide variety of clinical\\nscenarios and pathologies, some of them not that common in other european Countries. Austria follows European guidelines and\\nregulations, but there is a wider access to all breast imaging modalities. It is rather easy to get access to all the imaging modalities\\navailable, and examinations such as tomosynthesis and breast MRI are commonly used, even beyond current recommendations.\\n\\nMSCB51B\\n\\nTrue \\'Tales\\' of Breast Imaging in Malaysia\\n\\nParticipants\\nEvelyn Lai-Ming Ho, MBBS, MMed, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nevelyn.ho.laiming@ramsaysimedarbyhealth.com\\n\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n1) Provide a brief epidemiology of breast cancer in Malaysia. 2) Learn how geographical, sociocultural factors and financial/resource\\n\\n\\x0c1) Provide a brief epidemiology of breast cancer in Malaysia. 2) Learn how geographical, sociocultural factors and financial/resource\\nconstraints including personal beliefs/preferences impact diagnosis and management. 3)The interactive case based review will take\\ninto consideration objective no. 2 and where applicable - when ideal has to be modified because of availability, accessibility,\\naffordability and acceptability.\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n\\nTitle: True \\'Tales\\' of Breast Imaging in Malaysia Malaysia is a multicultural, multiethnic, small, middle-income country in South East\\nAsia. Breast cancer is the overall top cancer in Malaysia. Whilst early detection and optimal treatment for breast cancer and other\\nbreast conditions exist, the distribution of such services are in major cities especially on the west coast of Peninsula Malaysia,\\nmany centered around the capital of Kuala Lumpur. We have clinical practice guidelines for breast cancer management. There is no\\norganized population based screening mammogram program but over the years, opportunistic screening has increased due to rising\\nlevels of awareness. Barriers to even diagnostic mammograms include perception of pain; radiation risks and that compression can\\nspread cancer. Ultrasound is the most widely accepted imaging modality and therefore follow up compliance is relatively good,\\nsometimes preferred over immediate biopsy of even BI-RADS 4 lesions. Women may refuse a mammogram, even when clinically\\nindicated! Paradoxically, despite availability of MRI services in many major hospitals, specifically MRI breast is not widely available.\\nMRI is also expensive and requires Gadolinium contrast media. Factors for late presentation include fatalism, ignorance, fear of\\ncancer and belief in traditional therapies. Proliferative benign breast conditions are common. Our patients range from pre-pubertal\\nto the elderly and males. In addition, women fall prey to unlicenced injection breast augmentation. All these add to colorful but\\nchallenging situations, YET provide opportunities to connect with and counsel patients. Dealing with personal beliefs and\\npreferences despite standard of care recommendations is better than refusing them care at all and leaving them to their own\\ndevices. The spectrum of tales (clinical scenarios) will strive to illustrate the above. A handout is included for more in-depth\\ninformation of the Malaysian scene.\\n\\nMSCB51C Multimodal Approach to Breast Imaging: How It Works in Russia\\n\\nParticipants\\nKaterina A.

How it works in Russia. Katerina Busko Associate professor of Radiology N.N. Petrov\\nNational Medical Research Center of oncology Saint-Petersburg, Russia The Russian federation is the largest country in the world,\\noccupying 1/8 of the land area. Population of 146 million (2019) (78 million female, 68 million male). The World Bank has classified it\\nas a middle-income country. Overall life expectancy at birth is 72,60 years in 2019 (female 77,55; male 67,66 лет). There are more\\nthan 160 people living on the Russian Federation territory, in which the biggest one is Russian (111 millions of people or 77% of\\ncountry\\'s population). Tatar (5,5mln of people), Ukrainian (about 2mln of people), Bashkir, Chuvashi, Chechen and Armenian which\\nnumbered more than 1 mln of people. Homogenous nature of the population with predominance of Russian nationality is typical only\\nfor Central, Central-Chernosem and North-Western regions, whereas all other regions especially Northern Caucasus have mixed\\nnational composition of population. Russia is unique country according to the religion structure population: there are\\nrepresentatives of three world\\'s religions - Christian, Islam and Buddhism. The biggest cities are Moscow (capital) - 8 millions of\\npeople and Saint Petersburg - 5 millions of people. Being the most important center of economics, transportation, culture and\\nscience Saint Petersburg is still the heart of Russian history. The North capital, the city of three revolutions, Cultural capital,\\nNorthern Palmira, the city am Neva river, Northern Venice, the city of white nights - this is hardly a complete list of unofficial names\\nof Saint Petersburg. The public health care system (funded by general taxes) provides near universal healthcare coverage. Russia\\nspent 7 % of GDP on Healthcare in 2019. There are some differences in training radiation diagnostic doctors between Russia and\\nEurope and North America. After school (11 grades) graduation the future doctor should enter and graduate medical university (6\\nyears). To get the sub-specialty it\\'s necessary to go through residency (2 years). The main difference is in opportunity to make\\nthe choice between specialty of radiologist and the sonographer. Not all of the doctors have two specialty (Radiologist and\\nSonographer). Therefore, the realization of multimodal method of breast imaging is only possible in the lead national institutions, as\\na rule these are the scientific-research centers of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. And this poses the main problem. Generally, in\\nRussia the patient is examined by three doctors: radiologist doctors which describes only mammogram, radiologist who describes\\nonly MRI and the doctor who perform ultrasound investigation. Too narrow specialization doesn\\'t allow the doctors to see the full\\nimage of breast cancer diagnostics what sometimes could be the reasons of false positive and either false negative diagnoses.\\nWidely used BI-RADS system became compulsory in Russia about 5 years ago. Due to this, fact the doctors of different specialties\\n(radiologists, sonographers and oncologists) started to speak the same language. Stereotactic biopsy is performed by the\\nradiologist in specialized oncological institutions. In the great majority of cases the core biopsy is performed by the oncologist under\\nthe ultrasound control or by the surgeon together co-working with sonographer. Furthermore, we don\\'t have a clear separation of\\nvisualization a certain organ, it means that the diagnosis doctor works while general appointment, e.g. he could examine organs of\\npulmonary system, gastrointestinal tract and breast. There were about 35667 of doctors who worked in X-ray diagnosis department\\nin 2016 representing 5% of total number of medical staff (16611of radiologists and 15083 sonographers specialists are among them)\\nAll the government health institutions in Russia are equipped with mammographs and US scanners. However, there is a place for a\\nlack of profile specialists who do diagnostics only for breast. As a rule, MR tomography can be found only in big cities and not all of\\nthem are equipped with breast coil. According to statistics of 2016, in government health care institutions they found: 5014 US\\ndepartments; 1520 mammographic screening cabinets, 465 MRI departments. Considering the fact that private clinics\\' go through\\nactive development in Russia now, so the amount of diagnostic machines has doubled [1]. In 2016 6,3 mln of mammograms were\\nperformed. Analyzing the MR researching structure we can find out that only 1% is accounted for breast imaging (about 8000) [1].\\nLeading localizations in the general structure of cancer morbidity are presented in: skin(12,6% with melanoma - 14,4%), breast\\n(11,4%), trachea, bronchus and lungs (9,9%), colon (6,9%), prostate (6,8%), stomach (5,9%), rectum (5,0%) lymphatic and\\nhematopoietic tissues (4,8%), corporis uteri (4,3%), kidney (3,9%), pancreas (3,1%), cervix uteri (2,8%), bladder (2,8%), ovary\\n(2,3%). Breast cancer is presented as the main cancer-related pathology among female population of Russia, accounted about\\n21.1% among all female malignant tumors. The average age of patients with breast cancer diagnosed for the first time with\\nmalignant tumors in Russia in 2017 was 61,4 years old. Malignant tumors of breast have its peak of relative importance in a group\\nage of 30-59 years old (16.1%) [2]. Prevalence rates of women breast cancer are increasing: from 42,7 per 100 hundred of people\\n\\n\\x0cin 2007 to 51,9 per 100 hundred people in 2017, the morbidity growth in a decade amounted to 22,68%. In 2007-2017 period there\\nwas also marked the mortality rate decrease caused by breast cancer to 17,73% - from 17,17 to 14,24 per 100 hundred of people.\\nThe proportion of sick people with tumor process I-II stage according to the number of sick people for the first time diagnosed with\\nmalignant tumor in 2017 amounted to 69,9%. There was also marked the decrease of number of mortality, among patients\\nthroughout the year form the diagnose fact of WBC: from 10,1% in 2007 to 6,0% in 2017. Percentage of women registered for 5 or\\nmore years in 2017 amounted to 60,4% [3,4]. In general, the morbidity valuation of breast cancer indicates that Russia applies to\\nthe countries of so called \\'medium risk\\' zone - with lower rates than in European countries, North and South America; but higher\\nthan in Asian and African countries. In comparing the number of morbidity and mortality caused by breast cancer identified in our\\ncountry to the similar rates in the certain regions in the world, the negative situation takes place [5,6]. According to the weak\\nrates of morbidity the mortality rates are almost equal with ones in North and West Europe, North America and significantly higher\\nthan the world averages. Yearly about 23000 (22150 - 2018 year) of women are dying because of WBC in Russia. The raw rate per\\n100 000 of women accounts 27,9 0/0000, standard - 14,02 0/0000. Full number of morbidity of men caused by BC accounts 183\\n(0,26 0/000 - raw rates, 0,17 0/0000) in Russia [7,8]. Russia applies to countries without government screening support programs.\\nToday\\'s situation allows women (40-75 y.o.) to get the preventive mammography of both breasts in two projections with double\\ncheck radiologist\\'s reading biannually. The examination is free for women, which they can get after applying to the governmental\\nhealth care establishment and produce the passport and compulsory health insurance [9]. Also, all women can visit private clinic\\nand get MG, US and MRI examinations for a fee. The examination price is not so high and its available almost to all social groups.\\nNational Medical Research Center of oncology named after N. Petrov is one of the biggest federal scientific-treatment centers in\\nRussia. It is based in Pesochniy village nearby St-Petersburg. Center was founded in 1927 by the founder of Russian oncology\\nNikolay Petrov. Today National Medical Research Center of oncology provides specialized and high-tech health care at a level of the\\nworld standards. In the Radiology department of Petrov\\'s oncology center there are modern methods of breast imaging are used at\\npresent moment: Digital mammography, CESM, Ultrasound with elastography and contrast enhancement, MRI, ultrasound guided\\ncore biopsy, vacuum assisted biopsy. Women diagnosed with breast cancer get the positron emission mammography or\\nscintimammography to measure the incidence and for marking the sentinel lymph node for women with (c)T1-2N0M0 stage. Pre-\\noperative wire localization is performed for patient with nonpalpable breast lesions. Before the neoadjuvant chemotherapy the clips\\nare installing under the US control what makes the searching for tumors bed after NAC easier. Our center is one of the first in\\nRussia which started to use multimodality approach to breast imaging. Breast radiologist checks the mammography, MRI images and\\nin case of identifying the pathology performs the ultrasound diagnostics with elastography, and if it\\'s necessary ultrasound guided\\ncore biopsy can be performed by the same doctor. Also, the «Multidisciplinary Breast Cancer tumor boards» has its active\\ndeveloping in which masters of different specialties such as oncology, radiology and pathomorphology take part.

Prospective trials reported that 18F-Fluciclovine avid lesions were detected in 57% of\\npatients with BCR PC and 59% of them had a change in management after the scan. A recent update to the NCCN Guidelines®\\nrecommends that 18F-Fluciclovine PET be considered in the workup of patients with BCR PC. A growing number of studies in recent\\nyears have reported the superiority of PSMA-based PET to 18F-Fluciclovine PET. The advantage of PSMA-based PET stands out in\\nthe detection of lymph node metastases in patients with low PSA levels. 18F-Fluciclovine PET is non-inferior to PSMA PET in\\ndetecting distant metastases of patients with high PSA levels.Here we will review cases, including some who had both Axumin and\\nPSMA PET.\\n\\nMSCC34C\\n\\nSomatostatin Receptor PET Cases\\n\\nParticipants\\nCorina Millo, MD, Bethesda, MD (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nmillocm@nih.gov\\n\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n1) Evaluate applications of molecular imaging as a cancer biomarker. 2) Review clinical cases for which molecular imaging response\\napproaches are applicable. 3) Discuss investigational agents being investigated for response assessment and early results.\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n\\nThis talk will review molecular imaigng approaches for cancer, considering molecular imaging as a cancer biomarker to guide\\n\\n\\x0ctreatment decisions and evaluate therpaeutic repsonse.

Discuss mediastinal disorders in a case-based format3. Identify\\nthe typical imaging manifestations of these mediastinal abnormalities4. Present a practical & systematic approach in the evaluation\\nof these abnormalities\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n\\nThe mediastinum is located in the central chest between the right and the left pleural cavities and spans from the thoracic inlet to\\nthe diaphragm. It contains vital structures of the circulatory, respiratory, digestive, and nervous systems. The mediastinum is a\\ncommon location for non-vascular masses in children. The non-vascular lesions include congenital malformations, infectious\\nprocesses, as well as benign or malignant neoplasms.Medical imaging plays a vital role in detection, localization, characterization,\\nand definition of extent of these lesions in aid of prompt and appropriate management. Imaging also helps in the assessment of\\ncomplications, prognostication, and in imaging aided interventions. For this lecture, various imaging techniques for the evaluation of\\nmediastinal lesions are presented. The wide spectrum of non-vascular lesions will be discussed, with descriptions of typical imaging\\nmanifestations and current management considerations.

Is there a way to attain the coveted\\nconfidence-to-competence ratio of 1:1? Could effective peer review assist in this journey? Is it OK to make mistakes?

Intelligent, adaptable report\\ntemplates can leverage patient specific information to cater the report information and presentation to the patient\\'s needs,\\nmaximizing value. Finally, a practical framework will be offered on how to implement and utilize intelligent structured reports with\\nthe following goals: reducing errors, improving accuracy, fostering better communication and potentially increasing efficiency.\\n\\n\\x0cPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cMSES32\\n\\nEssentials of Chest Imaging\\n\\nMonday, Nov. 30 3:30PM - 4:30PM Room: Channel 3\\n\\nCH\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: 1.00\\n\\nParticipants\\nDiane C.

Any of these\\nconditions can be present in a patient who is \\'found-down\\'. Clinical assessment of these founddown patients becomes very limited\\nas there is no available history and physical exam is either not possible, or extremely limited, thus management becomes very\\nchallenging. Neuroimaging plays a critical role in recognizing conditions and findings that can acutely change patient management.\\nIn this talk we will discuss the differential diagnosis of a found-down patient and rapidly identify actionable diagnoses and\\npotentially reversible conditions which would otherwise be life threatening.\\n\\nMSES34D\\n\\nSinonasal Anatomy\\n\\nParticipants\\nCourtney M.

Patient cooperation is essential and requires specific\\npreparation, especially for breathhold acquisitions. Examination time is related to the number of acquisitions.T1 and T2 weighted\\nsequences are necessary, as well as Diffusion weighted imaging in most cases. Optional sequences includes extra cellular Gadolinium\\nchelate injection, use of liver specific contrast media and cholangio- and pancreatography. According to the clinical questions, the\\nprotocol can be tailored however it should not be entirely different for every patient. In this presentation, we will address the most\\ncommon MRI protocols, as well as some siutations where the examination can be shortened without any compromise on quality.\\n\\nMSES52D\\n\\nImaging of Colon: Beyond Cancer and Polyps\\n\\nParticipants\\nAndrea Laghi, MD, Rome, Italy (Presenter) Speaker, General Electric CompanySpeaker, Guerbet SASpeaker, Bayer AGSpeaker,\\nBracco GroupSpeaker, Merck & Co, Inc\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cMSMC21\\n\\nCardiac CT Mentored Case Review: Part I (In Conjunction with the North American Society for Cardiovascular\\nImaging)\\n\\nSunday, Nov. 29 10:00AM - 11:00AM Room: Channel 1\\n\\nCA\\n\\nCT\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: 1.00\\n\\nParticipants\\nDiana Litmanovich, MD, Boston, MA (Moderator) Nothing to Disclose\\nJill E.

Thisphenomenon is due to the success of\\nsurgical palliation and medical management of patients with even themost severe forms of CHD. Surgical intervention is often\\nperformed at the time of diagnosis and in patientswith residual hemodynamic lesions is often required throughout life.Though\\nechocardiography is typically the initial imaging modality of choice, diagnosis and imagingsurveillance of complex hemodynamic and\\nanatomic CHD lesions is now most often accomplished with CTand MR. CT and CTA imaging techniques may be used to show\\ndetailed anatomic and functional images ofthe heart, postoperative changes and long term consequences of CHD.An organized,\\nreproducible approach to identify cardiac anatomy of CHD lesions and surgical palliationshould be adopted in order to accurately and\\nthoroughly describe findings.\\n\\nMSMC24B\\n\\nLeft Atrial Pre- and Post Ablation Imaging\\n\\nParticipants\\nPhillip M.

To accurately interpret the scan and not to overlook the possible non-cardiac pathologies, familiarity with potential\\nincidental findings is required. Clinical importance and severity of incidental findings varies, thus currently existing algorithms for\\nincidental findings on cardiac CT are helpful for further work-up.\\n\\nMSMC24D Mixed Case-review Summary\\n\\nParticipants\\nDaniel Vargas, MD, Denver, CO (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\ndaniel.vargas@cuanschutz.edu\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cMSQI31\\n\\nQuality Improvement Symposium: High Functioning Interventional Radiology Teams\\n\\nIR SQ\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: 1.00\\n\\nParticipants\\nBettina Siewert, MD, Brookline, MA (Presenter) Editor, Wolters Kluwer nvReviewer, Wolters Kluwer nv\\n\\nSub-Events\\n\\nMSQI31A\\n\\nThe Importance of High Functioning Teams\\n\\nParticipants\\nBettina Siewert, MD, Brookline, MA (Presenter) Editor, Wolters Kluwer nvReviewer, Wolters Kluwer nv\\n\\nMSQI31B\\n\\nNew Skill Sets for Leaders of High Functioning Teams\\n\\nParticipants\\nDavid B.

Use of functional and molecular imaging and\\nadvanced radiotherapy often integrated with targeted chemotherapy have improved patient outcomes. Advanced radiotherapy\\ntechniques such as Image Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT), Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT), and Stereotactic Body\\nRadiation Therapy (SBRT) can be applied using image guidance with Xray, CT, MRI, PET-CT and PET-MRI. Image-guided\\nchemoembolization and thermal ablation also offer loco-regional therapy options for many disease sites. For patients with\\nmetastatic prostate or neuroendocrine cancer, the theranostic approach in nuclear medicine that couples diagnostic imaging and\\ntherapy using the same or very similar molecule is emerging as an important approach for tumor control.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cMSRP31\\n\\nRSNA Resident and Fellow Symposium: Job Market Update\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .50\\n\\nParticipants\\nStephane Desouches, DO, Milwaukee, WI (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cMSRP32\\n\\nRSNA Resident and Fellow Symposium: Review of the Changing Radiology Marketplace\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .50\\n\\nParticipants\\nHoward B.

Traditionally, MR scans were used\\nprimarily for the diagnosis and follow-up of oncology patients. In recent years, MRI has become an essential tool for simulation and\\ntreatment alignment for radiation therapy. MRI scanners are being installed in radiation oncology departments for simulation\\nprocedures and radiation therapy treatment machines are now capable of acquiring these images as well. This will require further\\ncollaboration and integration of radiology and radiation oncology personnel.

All patients require and deserve basic\\nhealthcare, but there is a deep chasm between the resourced and under-resourced worlds of healthcare. We in radiology are\\nfortunate to have so many advantages that can make us a worldwide specialty. We need to put to work the power and potential of\\nour professional and technical resources to close the gap in the quality of care across the world. Achieving the vision of a\\ncollaborative, more equitable radiology world will not be without its challenges. Each of us will have to make a conscious choice to\\ncollaborate worldwide. We must all decide to learn from each other, and we will need to be good stewards of our technology.\\nWinners in our equal, one-world of radiology will be radiologists who learn the habits, processes, and skills most quickly to adapt to\\nglobalization.

DeStigter, MD, Burlington, VT (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nAbstract\\n\\nMajor shifts have taken place in global burden of disease over past 25 years and present new challenges for reducing global health\\ninequalities within each of the main medical cause groups. The world\\'s member nations adopted the UN Sustainable Development\\nGoals in 2015, including a specific target to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) by 2030.Radiology is vital to disease detection\\nand treatment, yet has remained essentially invisible in health policy and funding recommendations on the global stage. Inequitable\\naccess to essential imaging is one of the greatest health challenges in resource-limited areas and has the greatest negative impact\\non socially and economically disadvantaged or otherwise marginalized populations. Core issues include the lack of access to\\naffordable technology, a limited skilled workforce, insufficient infrastructure, and systems gaps, all compounded by social\\ninequities.The Global Burden of Disease data represent the most comprehensive observational epidemiological prediction looking at\\n250 causes of death from 2016 to 2040 in 195 countries. By evaluating years of life lost and mortality for certain causes, top\\nconditions are forecasted and ranked for both adults and children. The future needs of radiology diagnostics are evident with large\\ngaps in access and service. Although many countries are impacted, a disproportionately high burden of disease will remain in sub-\\nSaharan Africa.Without access to integrated high quality imaging services in low resource areas, effective UHC will not be\\nachievable. We are faced with a \"wicked problem\" - a problem that is so difficult to solve that our traditional methods of addressing\\nradiology services in global health are unlikely to effect significant change. Cross-sector collaboration that engages academia,\\nindustry, civil society and NGOs, governments, local radiologists and communities is paramount.Our collaborative focus must be on\\ncapacity building and capability strengthening, including through scientific discovery and dissemination, education, mentorship,\\nregulatory advisement, and advocacy to policy makers. Sustainable radiology interventions will be safe, cost-effective, integrate\\ninto systems of care with a delicate balance of centralized and decentralized services, and cultivate the trust of the communities\\nserved. It is our moral obligation to convene effective partnerships with multipronged approaches that improve equitable access to\\nradiology services.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cPS12\\n\\nImage Interpretation Session: Neuroradiology & Head and Neck\\n\\nMonday, Nov. 30 2:00PM - 2:30PM Room: Channel 1\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .50\\n\\nParticipants\\nChristine M.

The interdisciplinary collaborations between medical physicists who leverage these\\ntechnical  advances  to  solve  clinical  problems  identified  by  practicing  radiologists  are  critical  factors  in  the  success  of  our  field.\\nLikewise, translation of these new methods from bench to bedside and into clinical practice requires partnerships beyond the walls\\nof  academia. In  this  presentation  we  focus  on  the  individuals  and  events  that  contributed  to  a  series  of  X-Ray,  MR  and  CT\\ntechniques for diagnostic and interventional angiographic applications, and share lessons learned from the successes and challenges\\nof these efforts.  Specifically, we will begin with the origins of 2D  Digital  Subtraction  Angiography (DSA) which has facilitated the\\ndevelopment of interventional radiology. Subsequently the need for time-resolved MRA data led to the creation of accelerated data\\nacquisition schemes in MR angiography which introduced the general concept of under-sampled data acquisition in the time domain.\\nThese efforts led to the development of time-resolved 3D Time-Resolved Imaging of Contrast Kinetics (3D-TRICKS MRA), an analog\\nof  X-ray  DSA. Partnerships between academia and industry were key factors in the dissemination of these methods to ultimately\\nbenefit  human  health. The  concept  of  under-sampling  in  MR  angiography  was  then  extended  to  the  spatial  domain  using  radial\\nacquisition methods to significantly accelerate 4D flow phase-contrast MRA acquisitions, thus enabling simultaneous anatomic and\\nfunctional assessment of vascular health and disease. The simultaneous spatial and temporal under-sampling methods developed for\\nMRA have since been applied to cone-beam x-ray  CTA, therefore creating 4D  DSA, a time-resolved 3D version of  DSA capable of\\nmeasuring  of  blood  velocities.  All  of  these  developments  were  grounded  in  physical  principles,  developed  in  response  to  clinical\\nneeds  perceived  by  collaborating  radiologists,  and  ultimately  disseminated  to  improve  patient  care  through  partnerships  with\\norganizations beyond the walls of academia.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cPS40\\n\\nAnnual Oration in Radiation Oncology: Imagers and Images-My friends; My Indispensable Guide\\n\\nW ednesday, Dec. 2 11:00AM - 12:00PM Room: Channel 1\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .75\\n\\nParticipants\\nBeth A. Erickson, MD, Milwaukee, WI (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n\\nDiagnostic Radiology and Radiation Oncology have been closely aligned since their evolution from a single specialty, often residing in\\nthe same department, to the present day. Increasingly, imaging has proven essential to the successful design and delivery of\\nradiation therapy for cancer. In the 1980s, when CT scanners became available, these machines were shared and used selectively\\nfor radiation treatment planning. Image-based planning then evolved such that CT simulators became standard equipment in\\nradiation oncology departments. However, diagnostic CT images remained integral to the staging and follow up of patients treated\\nby radiation oncologists. Magnetic resonance imaging more slowly integrated into radiation planning and delivery systems, but used\\nfor diagnostic purposes, it gave radiation oncologists critical information about the cancers they were treating with the excellent\\nsoft tissue resolution provided by these images. Initially fused with radiation planning images, MR imaging has also gradually moved\\ninto radiation oncology departments for external beam and brachytherapy planning, especially for gynecologic cancers. Recently,\\nlinear accelerators equipped with online MR imaging capabilities have enabled real time monitoring of tumor and organ motion during\\neach treatment as well as the ability to adapt the dose specification as tumors change over the course of treatment. Defining and\\ntreating cancers with this level of precision has allowed for dose escalation with or without treatment acceleration, improved cure\\nrates and decreased morbidity. In addition, these images themselves have become biomarkers, informing radiation oncologists of\\ntumor response and identifying radiomic features, previously untapped, which provide a window into prognosis. PET imaging has\\nprovided similar diagnostic and prognostic information. Use of ultrasound to guide invasive brachytherapy procedures is an\\ninvaluable asset ensuring procedural accuracy and safety. Interventional radiology has further enabled strategic placement of\\nradiation as well as expertise in mitigating radiation morbidity such as insufficiency fractures. Though often working apart,\\ndiagnostic radiologists and the images they interpret and share, are fundamental to the success of radiation therapy. Radiation\\noncologists remain essentially and integrally aligned with our diagnostic colleagues and friends in our mutual quest to cure cancer.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cRC101\\n\\nLung Cancer Screening\\n\\nSaturday, Dec. 5 5:00PM - 6:00PM Room: Channel 2\\n\\nCH CT\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: 1.00\\n\\nParticipants\\nCaroline Chiles, MD, Winston-salem, NC (Moderator) Advisory Board, AstraZeneca PLC\\n\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n1) Confirm compliance with screening guidelines, including patient eligibility, scanning protocols, radiation dose, CMS requirements\\nand National Lung Screening Registry. 2) Incorporate shared decision making and smoking cessation in the lung screening visit. 3)\\nAssign Lung-RADS categories to nodules encountered at baseline and annual screening CT. 4) Evaluate atypical screening findings.\\n5) Manage incidental findings, including COPD, coronary artery calcification, and potential extrapulmonary malignancies.\\n\\nSub-Events\\n\\nRC101A\\n\\nIntroduction\\n\\nParticipants\\nCaroline Chiles, MD, Winston-salem, NC (Presenter) Advisory Board, AstraZeneca PLC\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\ncchiles@wakehealth.edu\\n\\nRC101B\\n\\nFeasible Approaches to Shared Decision-making for Lung Cancer Screening\\n\\nParticipants\\nRobert Volk, PhD, Houston, TX (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nRC101C\\n\\nNodule Assessment and Lung-RADS™ Categories\\n\\nParticipants\\nMylene T.

In those individuals with a genetic\\npredisposition the lifetime risk can be up to 80%. For those without a genetic predisposition age is still the greatest risk but family\\nhistory can play a role as well as breast density. Single nucleotide polymorphisms have a very small risk but can give an additive\\neffect. Together this information can be used to create a risk profile. For those women in the higher risk categories a more\\ntargetted imaging strategy can be used. This is being explored in the WISDOM and MyPEBS trials where frequency of mammography\\nis being varied according to risk. Breast density can mask breast cancers and lead to detection at a later stage or presentation as\\ninterval cancers. These larger cancers have a much worse prognosis. Supplemental imaging is being advocated to to detect\\ncancers at an earlier stage. However it is important to evaluate the variaous techniquessuch as abbreviated MRI, Contrast\\nenhanced mammography and breast ultrasound as in the BRAID trial. The size, type and grade of additional cancers that are found\\nas well as interval cancer rates are important to estimate the benefits of making such changes to a screening programme.\\n\\nRC118C\\n\\nLung Cancer Screening\\n\\nParticipants\\nClaudia I.

Medical imaging has always been\\nan integral part of disease diagnosis and treatment decisions. With the possibility to use AI for image, i.e radiomics analysis to\\nidentify findings either detectable or not by the human eye, radiology is now moving from a subjective perceptual skill to a more\\nobjective science. Out of the myriad proposed use-cases for AI in radiology, breast cancer is one of the most researched.\\nAdvances in radiomics analysis, i.e. the extraction and correlation of multiple imaging parameters with different variables of interest\\n(patients\\' characteristics, histopathologic, genomic, molecular or outcome data) and machine learning (such as deep learning) are\\non the cusp of providing more effective, more efficient, and even more patient-centric breast cancer care support than ever\\nbefore. Radiogenomics aims to correlate imaging characteristics (i.e., the imaging phenotype) with gene expression patterns, such\\nas molecular subtypes, gene mutations, and other genome-related characteristics. Radiogenomics is designed to facilitate a deeper\\nunderstanding of molecular tumor biology through the extraction of parameters derived from image processing and analyses of\\nmedical images that are linked to the geno- and phenotypic characteristics of the tissue. Due to the non-invasive nature of medical\\nimaging and its ubiquitous use in clinical practice, the field of radio/-genomics is rapidly evolving and initial results are encouraging.\\nThis presentation will explain the concept and methodology of radiomics/genomics and AI, summarize the current applications of\\nradiomics/genomics in breast imaging and address its challenges and limitations.\\n\\nRC215B\\n\\nGenetic Mutations Associated with Breast Cancer\\n\\nParticipants\\nCindy S.

Unlike soft tissue metastases, significant cortical\\ndisruption is required before a bone metastases is visible on CT, and bone scan demonstrates the effect of the metastases on\\nbone, rather than the metastases themselves. MR partially overcomes these limitations, as early bone metastases can be detected.\\nHowever, even after bone metastases are apparent on imaging, it is difficult to assess their evolution with regards to therapy\\nresponse.\\n\\nRC218B\\n\\nWB-MRI of Multiple Myeloma: My-RADS\\n\\nParticipants\\nChristina Messiou, MD, BMBS, London, United Kingdom (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n1) List indications for WB-MRI in multiple myeloma. 2) Describe the core and comprehensive protocols for WB-MRI in multiple\\nmyeloma. 3) Apply a systematic approach to reporting WB-MRI in multiple myeloma as outlined in MY-RADS. 4) Review the MY-RADS\\ncriteria for assessing disease phenotype, burden and response assessment with case examples.\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n\\nAcknowledging the increasingly important role of WB-MRI for directing myeloma patient care, a multidisciplinary international expert\\npanel of radiologists, medical physicists and haematologists convened to discuss the performance standards, merits and limitations\\nof WB-MRI in myeloma.

MET-RADS is suitable for\\nguiding patient care in practice (using the regional and overall assessment criteria), but can also be incorporated into clinical trials\\nwhen accurate lesion size and ADC measurements become more important (the recording of measurements is not mandated for\\nclinical practice). MET-RADS enables the evaluation of the benefits of continuing therapy to be assessed, when there are signs\\n\\n\\x0cthat the disease is progressing (discordant responses). MET-RAD requires validation within clinical trials initially in studies that\\nassess the effects of known efficacious treatments. METRADS measures should be correlated to other tumor response biomarkers,\\nquality of life measures, rates of skeletal events, radiographic progression free survival and overall survival.

Feedback received after the talk has revealed that\\nthree of these companies (GalileoCDS, Mindshare Medical and QuantX) are in fact alive and well, albeit silent in terms of the \\'vital\\nsigns\\' criteria used. In particular Dr Harvey would like to clarify that QuantX rebranded to Qlarity Imaging in June 2019 (and\\ntherefore \\'QuantX\\' was absent from his search results for 2020).

Glastonbury, MBBS, San Francisco, CA (Presenter) Author with royalties, Reed Elsevier\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nCHRISTINE.GLASTONBURY@UCSF.EDU\\n\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n1) To understand the normal course of the vagus and recurrent laryngeal nerves through the neck, and useful anatomic landmarks\\nand therefore the areas requiring scrutiny for patients with vocal cord paralysis (VCP). 2) To recognize the clinical difference\\nbetween upper and lower vagal neuropathies and how this might affect imaging technique and modality recommendations. 3) To\\nreview common and unusual causes of VCP with an emphasis on CT and MR imaging.\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n\\nThe recurrent laryngeal nerve is a branch of the vagus nerve [CN10] and provides motor innervation to the endolaryngeal muscles\\nof the vocal cords. The recurrent laryngeal nerve also provides sensory innervation to the subglottis and proximal cervical\\nesophagus. The right recurrent laryngeal nerve arises from the vagus nerve at the level of the subclavian artery and loops around\\nthe artery before ascending in the tracheoesophageal groove. The left recurrent laryngeal nerve arises from the vagus anterior to\\nthe aortic arch and loops through the aortopulmonary window before ascending in the tracheoesophageal groove. Neuropathies are\\nclinically divided into those arising below the hyoid, that is, those affecting only the recurrent laryngeal branch and therefore with\\npreserved soft palate and constrictor muscle function and intact gag reflex. And those above the hyoid, which are frequently\\nassociated with neuropathies of CN9, CN11, and CN12. We will review this anatomy, how to detect vocal cord paralysis (VCP) on\\nimaging and how to review scans for causes of VCP.\\n\\nRC306B\\n\\nHorner\\'s Syndrome\\n\\nParticipants\\nDeborah L.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is most commonly caused by a single parathyroid adenoma but can also result\\nfrom multiglandular hyperplasia, double parathyroid adenoma, and parathyroid carcinoma. Surgical removal of the abnormal\\nparathyroid tissue is the only definitive cure. Primary hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed with biochemical testing rather than imaging.\\nThe role of imaging is localization of the abnormal parathyroid tissue, which facilitates operative cure. Ultrasound, nuclear medicine,\\nand multiphase (so-called \\'4D\\') CT are the most commonly performed imaging modalities for preoperative localization. Although each\\nimaging technique has relative strengths and weaknesses, each technique is also capable of providing useful and accurate\\nlocalization information for operative planning. Not uncommonly, more than one preoperative imaging study is performed in an\\n\\n\\x0cattempt to maximize localization confidence via concordant imaging results. Regardless of the preoperative imaging technique(s)\\nused, the key information the surgeon desires for operative planning includes: number, size, and location of candidate parathyroid\\nlesions with respect to relevant surgical landmarks; the radiologist\\'s opinion and confidence level regarding what each candidate\\nlesion represents; and the presence or absence of ectopic or supernumerary parathyroid tissue, concurrent thyroid pathology, and\\narterial anomalies associated with a nonrecurrent laryngeal nerve.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cRC307\\n\\nOvarian Cancer Imaging: Radiologists as Partners in Cancer Care\\n\\nSaturday, Dec. 5 10:00AM - 11:00AM Room: Channel 1\\n\\nGU OI\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: 1.00\\n\\nParticipants\\nKatherine E.

The CT scan appearances can assist in\\ndetermining whether the patient should initially be treated with up-front surgery or should have neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The\\ndetection of peritoneal disease and its distribution is critical for making this decision. This lecture will review the appearance of\\ndisseminated ovarian cancer on CT, demonstrate the \"difficult to operate\" areas and review the challenges and pitfalls on CT. MR is\\nemerging as a tool that may help to better demonstrate the extent of peritoneal disease.

The availability of an ever growing amount of medical\\nimages, and the increasing availability of affordable computation resources allows to apply deep learning technologies to many\\ndifferent problems. However, the scope of problems for which deep learning currently performs on par or outperforms humans is\\nrather narrow. The required human and financial effort makes it important to be able to determine clinical problems where deep\\nlearning could bring an advantage. After this refresher course, you will be aware of the state-of-the-art in deep learning for image\\nsegmentation, analysis and reconstruction. You will be able to critically assess the impact and applicability of deep learning\\ntechnology in radiation oncology and be able to find future clinical opportunities.\\n\\nRC322B\\n\\nMachine Learning Tumor Classification\\n\\nParticipants\\nJayashree Kalpathy-Cramer, MS, PhD, Charlestown, MA (Presenter) Research support, General Electric CompanyResearch support,\\nF.

The electric current produced by the EID is digitized, and used to reconstruct the digital image from CT. A newer type of\\n\\n\\x0cdetector uses digital technology: the photon counting detector (PCD). As implied by the name, the PCD tracks the individual\\nnumber of incident photons in addition to the energy of the incident photon. There are two inherent advantages to PCD for human\\nimaging: 1) the potential for lowered radiation dose due to greater efficiency of the PCD, and 2) improved spectral CT imaging.\\nThese characteristics further translate to specific advantages for CT of the neurologic imaging. In particular, photon counting CT\\nhas been demonstrated to have less beam hardening artifact around the spine and areas of the brain with extensive bone as well\\nas improved gray-white matter differentiation. This results in more accurate quantitative imaging. In addition, PCDs have 2 to 4-fold\\ngreater spatial resolution than conventional CT x-ray detectors. The purpose of this review will be to provide background on PCD\\ntechnology for CT as well as potential advantages or CT imaging of the brain and spine.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cRC406\\n\\nTemporal Bone\\n\\nHN NR\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: 1.00\\n\\nSub-Events\\n\\nRC406A\\n\\nTemporal Bone Anatomy\\n\\nParticipants\\nCaroline D.

The participant will be able to\\norganize potential diagnoses based on anatomic landmarks within the temporal bone.3. The participant will be able to explain\\npotential complications of treatment based on the extension of the tumor.\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n\\nThe temporal bone is one of the most complex structures in the human body. This complexity can be an advantage in attempting to\\ndetermine the identity of a tumor in the temporal bone. Certain tissues give rise to certain types of neoplasms and so an anatomic\\napproach allows better determination of category of tumor. Location also helps predict potential complications of therapy. This talk\\nseparates the temporal bone into regions and discusses an approach to tumor found in those areas.\\n\\nRC406D\\n\\nPost-operative Temporal Bone\\n\\nParticipants\\nGul Moonis, MD, South Orange, NJ (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cRC407\\n\\nA Case-based Audience Participation Session (Genitourinary)\\n\\nGU\\n\\nParticipants\\nPeter S.

However, cross-sectional imaging is essential because more than\\none-third of patients with acute RUQ pain do not have acute cholecystitis. In addition, patients with complications of acute\\ncholecystitis, such as perforation, are often best treated with supportive measures initially and elective cholecystectomy later.\\nPatients presenting to emergency with acute RUQ pain should be imaged in a timely fashion. Ultrasound (US) is the primary imaging\\nmodality for assessment of these patients; US is both sensitive and specific in demonstrating gallstones, biliary dilatation, and\\nfeatures that suggest acute inflammatory disease. Occasionally, additional imaging modalities are indicated. Computed tomography\\nis valuable, especially for confirming the nature and extent of the complications of acute cholecystitis. Successful imaging of these\\npatients requires familiarity with both the characteristic and the unusual features of a wide variety of pathologic conditions and is\\nbest performed by the medical imaging department.

The traditional\\nmaximum outer diameter is useful but has important limitations. Accordingly, other tools are essential and include the appearance of\\nperiappendiceal fat, color Doppler flow patterns, spectral Doppler point peak systolic velocity and spectral Doppler point resistive\\nindex.

Changes in tumor metabolism over time are now known to be early\\nbiomarkers of successful response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. There are a number of imaging methods that have been used\\nto probe cancer metabolism: the most widely available is 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), an analogue of glucose, used in PET.\\nHyperpolarized carbon-13 MRI (13C-MRI) is an emerging molecular imaging technique for studying cellular metabolism, particularly in\\nthe field of oncology. This method allows non-invasive measurements of tissue metabolism in real-time. To date, the most promising\\nprobe used in conjunction with hyperpolarized MRI has been 13C-labelled pyruvate: pyruvate is metabolized into lactate in normal\\ntissue in the absence of oxygen, but in tumors this occurs very rapidly even in the presence of oxygen. Results from many animal\\nmodels have shown that there is a reduction in the metabolism of pyruvate following successful treatment with chemotherapy.\\nTumor lactate labelling has also been shown to correlate with the grade of some tumor types. There are now a small number of\\nsites performing human hyperpolarized carbon-13 MRI imaging. This talk will discuss the progress that has been made in this field\\nwithin the area of oncology and potential clinical applications.\\n\\n\\x0cPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cRC421\\n\\nInnovations in Dual- and Multi-energy CT\\n\\nSunday, Nov. 29 5:00PM - 6:00PM Room: Channel 3\\n\\nCT\\n\\nPH\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: 1.00\\n\\nParticipants\\nLifeng Yu, PhD, Rochester, MN (Moderator) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n1) Review dual-energy CT systems that are commercially available and multi-energy CT systems that are currently under\\ndevelopment. 2) Review basic data processing and material decomposition techniques for dual-energy and multi-energy CT data. 3)\\nReview current and potential clinical applications of dual-energy and multi-energy CT.\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n\\nThis session will provide an overview of CT systems, data processing, and clinical applications of dual-energy and multi-energy CT.\\n\\nSub-Events\\n\\nRC421A\\n\\nDual- and Multi-energy CT Systems\\n\\nParticipants\\nTaly Gilat Schmidt, PhD, Milwaukee, WI (Presenter) Research grant, GE Healthcare\\n\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n1) Describe and compare the different approaches for acquiring multi-energy CT data. 2) Identify the important features of multi-\\nenergy CT systems and how they impact the acquired multi-energy data.\\n\\nRC421B\\n\\nDual- and Multi-energy Data Processing\\n\\nParticipants\\nKatsuyuki Taguchi, PhD, Baltimore, MD (Presenter) Research Grant, Siemens AGResearch Grant, Canon Medical Systems Corporation\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nktaguchi@jhmi.edu\\n\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n1) Better understanding of spectral processing schemes. 2) Using more dual-energy protocols in clinical routines.\\n\\nRC421C\\n\\nClinical Applications of Dual- and Multi-energy CT\\n\\nParticipants\\nJoel G.

This multivariate\\nsensitivity provides a powerful opportunity for tissue characterization via multiparameter mapping, i.e., quantifying multiple\\ncomplementary contrast mechanisms, properties, and phenomena in a single imaging session or scan. However, serial acquisition of\\nmultiple contrasts and measurements leads to long exam times and difficult workflows, especially in moving organs.

The\\npurpose of this presentation is to review pathophysiology and diagnostic tools to identify, localize and characterize\\nmyocarditis.Methods and Results: Various conditions such as infection or immune response directed against myocardium may result\\nin myocarditis. Before cardiac MRI became available the diagnosis of myocarditis was based on exclusion of other diseases in the\\ncontext of myocardial injury of unknown cause. Whilst Nuclear Imaging is hampered by poor spatial resolution, Late Gadolinium\\nenhanced MRI (LGE-MRI) was the first technique for imaging myocarditis with high spatial resolution. The advent of T2-mapping\\nenabled distinction of acute myocarditis from scar post myocarditis. Today with T1-mapping before and after contrast\\nadministration and Extracellular Volume (ECV)-mapping we have an array of tools in our hands to define disease severity and\\nactivity and thus to predict outcome and to guide therapy. Calculation of ECV, however, requires blood sampling for hematocrit.\\nTechniques for ECV-mapping without blood sampling are currently being explored. Today cardiac MRI enables distinction of chronic\\nfrom healed myocarditis and also dilated cardiomyopathy from chronic myocarditis.Conclusion: Myocarditis can have multiple\\ncauses, MRI is modality of choice to identify and characterize myocarditis as well as to predict outcome and guide therapy.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cRC504\\n\\nShoulder Imaging in Athletes\\n\\nSunday, Nov. 29 8:30AM - 9:30AM Room: Channel 1\\n\\nMK MR\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: 1.00\\n\\nSub-Events\\n\\nRC504A\\n\\nRotator Cuff Injuries\\n\\nParticipants\\nSoterios Gyftopoulos, MD, Scarsdale, NY (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nRC504B\\n\\nLabral Injuries\\n\\nParticipants\\nJenny T.

Though a Cloud-connection (RadPix) your device will serve as a\\ndedicated prostate-MRI workstation through which you can analyse 20 cases. This activity is best done on a laptop or tablet.\\nAlthough phones and small tablets will work, their small size limits optimal image viewing.Focus will be on the overall assessment of\\nPI-RADS v2.1 category. You will be interactively teached how to score the probability of the presence of a significant prostate in\\npatients with elevated PSA or other suspicion to have prostate cancer. All 20 cases are from daily practice, and have various levels\\nof difficulty. They include easy and difficult significant cancers, inflammation, BPH, and most common pitfalls. Internationally\\nrenowned teachers will guide you during your PI-RADS v2.1 scoring process. You will be able to ask them all question you have on\\nprostate mp-MRI, from acquisition to diagnosis to MR-biopsy.

The potential safety\\nrisks associated with each of these energies is unique/different those associated with each of the other fields. Further, the spatial\\ndistributions of these energies over the patient being examined is also unique to each field.The focus of this presentation is to help\\nthe attendee understand how these energies/fields may interact with an implant, device, or foreign body, as well as defining a\\nstandardized methodology for assessing the potential risks of scanning any device, implant, or foreign body in any MR scanner for\\nany MR examination on any part of the body. The presentation will rely heavily on custom developed software to help standardize\\nthe graphic display, understanding, analysis, quantification, and reporting of the potential risks of implant/device/foreign body MR\\nimaging in any of dozens of detailed modeled clinical MR scanners in use today.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cRC524\\n\\nTrends in the Modern Radiology Marketplace (Sponsored by the RSNA Professionalism Committee)\\n\\nAI\\n\\nLM PR\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: 1.00\\n\\nParticipants\\nBrandon P.

Radiographics. April/ May 2018) in which radiologist reports contain hyperlinked text, directing clinicians to the\\ncorresponding image annotation (most often two-diameter measurements). Our prior studies have also demonstrated notable time\\nsavings for oncologists (three times faster) when they use the hyperlinked target lesion measurements for their patients (Folio L.\\nRSNA 2015) as they spend significantly less time \"hunting\" for measurements in the previous text-only reports.Bookmark tables\\nwithin our PACS (VuePACS V12, Carestream Health, Rochester, NY) contain fields where \"radiologist assistants\" (RAs) can label\\ntarget lesions. In one ongoing study (Toscano A. SCBT.MR 2018), RAs simulate an AI workflow where target lesions are measured\\nbefore radiologists open the exam for interpretation. This improves target lesion selection and measurement concordance while\\nsaving radiologists time by not having to identify or measure these lesions. Once verified, radiologists import the active annotation\\nas a link into our report by dictating the word \"hyperlink,\" which minimizes the potential transcription error of three sets of numbers\\n(measurement, series and image numbers) and other metadata (e.g. x,y image and z table space, comparison of current with prior\\nmeasurements for RECIST calculations, lesion measurement creator).We have followed adoption of hyperlinks since we started the\\ncapability and showed a rapid rise of use and that body radiologists use the most hyperlinks (about 80% of all CT), followed by\\nbody MR, PET CT and nueroradiology. We also collect data on use of annotations, with two-diameter the most frequent, followed\\nby linear, ovals then arrows (least frequent). Preliminary work indicates that two-diameter and ovals better guide bounding boxes\\nfor deep learning with the annotations directly associated with the the hyperlinked text.Lastly, we have been analyzing clinician\\nclick-through behaviors where we can objectively demonstrate report value as a function of number of clicks on linked text, thus\\nverifying clinician interaction with radiologist reports. We can also analyze radiologists\\' clicks on prior report text and noted that\\n\\n\\x0cbody radiologists (for example) frequently click on these reports while dictating their interpretations.\\n\\nRC553D\\n\\nStructured Automated Recommendations: Reporting in the Era of Artificial Intelligence\\n\\nParticipants\\nTarik K.

Such partnerships can generate\\nproduct solutions for complex clinical problems by forming alliances between academic institutions, medical industries, and other\\nstakeholders to marshal key technologies, information, and resources in response to these clinical challenges. In radiology, AI can\\nbe used to manage the flood of data from digital imaging systems.

However, AI advances in medical imaging explore mostly uncharted territory fraught with uncertainties. This lecture\\naims at helping interested parties understand features of the academic-industrial partnership approach, describes interplay among\\nits participating clinicians, scientists, engineers, and other experts, and will chart possible pathways towards solving the\\nperformance, economic, cultural, ethical, legal, and regulatory considerations needed to transform AI ideas into clinically useful\\ntools.\\n\\nRC554D\\n\\nEthics of Sharing Clinical Data in AI\\n\\nParticipants\\nDavid B.

The emergence of\\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) made a tool available that enabled psychiatric researchers to examine with great\\nanatomical detail the relationship between psychological phenomena and brain physiology. Yet, almost thirty years later, it is\\nimportant to take a step back and examine how this tool has helped to elucidate physiological and pathological anxiety related\\nprocesses and to specifically address the challenges that lay ahead. Historically, there are currently no biological markers for\\npsychiatric disorders even more than 50 years after the rise of biological psychiatry. Second, most studies that are currently\\npresented are not aimed to examine whether neuroimaging can be used as a biological marker for a particular disorder. Instead,\\nneuroimaging studies focus on the ability to show differences in neural activation due to specific processing of information across\\ngroups not within an individual. Third, the characteristics of fMRI, i.e. changing blood flow as a function of energetic demand in\\nparts of the brain, and signal to noise characteristics of fMRI, i.e. the influence of thermal, physical, and physiological noise on the\\nsignal, may be such that fMRI may not be usable as a biological marker on an individual basis. In clinical practice it is essential to\\n\\n\\x0cknow how a particular test result predicts the risk of a condition, i.e. does a particular person have the condition when he/she has\\na positive test result. Likelihood ratios are a unique approach to calculate the probability of the condition, while adapting for\\nvarying prior probabilities, i.e. the chance of having a condition at the outset. Positive Likelihood Ratio (PLR) is the ratio of the\\nproportion of patients who have the target condition and test positive to the proportion of patients without the target condition\\nwho also test positive. Negative Likelihood Ratio (NLR) is the ratio of the proportion of patients who have the target condition who\\ntest negative to the proportion of patients without the target condition who also test negative. For example, a PLR > 10 may rule\\nin diseases with a pre-test probability between 30% and 70%, i.e. when one is clinically uncertain. In comparison, a NLR of < 0.1\\nmay rule out diseases with this pre-test probability. These test characteristics can be easily used in a graphical interface, e.g. the\\nFagan Nomogram, such that the clinician can calculate the approximate probability of an individual having a pathological condition\\nwith a positive / negative test result. Unfortunately, we still do not know answers to some basic questions that we may hope to\\naddress using fMRI in individuals with psychiatric disorders. First, there is no general account of what brain processing may causally\\ncontribute to the establishing of anxiety disorders. For example, is there a universal mechanism that results in the development of\\npsychiatric disorders, or is there a minimal set of processes that when they occur together produce clinically significant psychiatric\\nproblems? Second, we do not know the discriminative ability of fMRI, i.e. the degree to which differences in neural activation\\npattern can be related to different types of psychiatric disorders. Third, it is a wide open question whether neuroimaging can\\nfunction as a test for individuals with psychiatric disorders. Imaging techniques have not contributed so far to improve diagnoses or\\ntreatment of psychiatric disorders. This is clearly the charge and challenge for the next decades.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cRC606\\n\\nUpper Aerodigestive Tract Anatomy and Pathology\\n\\nHN NR\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: 1.00\\n\\nSub-Events\\n\\nRC606A\\n\\nNasopharynx\\n\\nParticipants\\nNancy J.

Andreotti, MD, Nashville, TN (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nrochelle.f.andreotti@vanderbilt.edu\\n\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n1) To understand a new standard lexicon for ovarian/adnexal mass evaluation using ultrasound. 2) To apply the lexicon to the\\ndevelopment of a risk stratification classification incorporating all levels of risk. 3) To be aware of management strategies for each\\nrisk category that can be reached based upon use of lexicon descriptors or the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) ADNEX\\nmathematical model.\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n\\nThe goal of the 2019 published Ovarian-Adnexal Reporting and Data System (O-RADS) US risk stratification and management\\nsystem is to provide consistent interpretations and decrease or eliminate ambiguity in US reports resulting in a higher probability of\\naccuracy in assigning risk of malignancy to ovarian and other adnexal masses as well as provide a management recommendation for\\neach risk category. Developed by an international multidisciplinary committee sponsored by the American College of Radiology, the\\nsystem applies the standardized reporting tool for US based on the 2018 published lexicon of the O-RADS US working group. For risk\\nstratification,the O-RADS US system consists of six categories (O-RADS 0-5), encompassing normal to high risk of malignancy. This\\nunique system represents a collaboration between the pattern-based approach commonly used in North America and the widely\\nused, European-based, International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) Assessment of Different Neoplasias in the Adnexa (ADNEX)\\nmodel, a mathematical risk prediction model that has undergone successful prospective and external validation. The pattern\\napproach relies on a subgroup of the most predictive descriptors in the lexicon based on a retrospective review of evidence\\nobtained in the IOTA phase 1-3 prospective studies and other supporting studies that assist in differentiating management schemes\\nin a variety of almost certainly benign lesions. With the addition of O-RADS US working group consensus, guidelines for management\\nin the different risk categories are proposed. Both systems have been stratified to reach the same risk categories and management\\nstrategies. At this time, O-RADS US is the only lexicon and classification system that includes all risk categories with their\\nassociated management schemes.\\n\\nRC607C\\n\\nManagement of Incidental Adnexal Findings on CT and MRI: An ACR Update\\n\\nParticipants\\nMaitray D. Patel, MD, Phoenix, AZ (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\npatel.maitray@mayo.edu\\n\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n1. Use the term simple-appearing cyst as recommended by the ACR Committee on Incidental Findings for describing cysts on CT\\n\\n\\x0c1. Use the term simple-appearing cyst as recommended by the ACR Committee on Incidental Findings for describing cysts on CT\\nand MR that are round or oval in shape, with homogeneous fluid attenuation or signal, with a thin or imperceptible wall and no solid\\ncomponent.2. Recognize the size thresholds for recommending further imaging of simple-appearing cysts on CT studies with\\ncontrast, CT studies without contrast, and fully-characterized MR studies.\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n\\nIncidental adnexal findings on CT and MR examinations of the female pelvis are common; the ACR provides an algorithm to guide\\nmanagement of the incidental adnexal mass based on whether the mass is (1) a simple-appearing cyst; (2) has reasonably\\ndiagnostic imaging features; or (3) has an uncertain diagnosis. Simple appearing cysts on CT or MR have very low risk of\\nmalignancy. Imaging follow-up is justified only when the cyst is relatively large for the patient\\'s menopausal status. The primary\\ngoals of imaging follow-up are to limit the risk of cyst mischaracterization and to understand the rate of growth, which may inform\\nsubsequent clinical decision-making. Recommendations regarding the optimal timing of sonographic follow-up for a large simple-\\nappearing cyst balances the small potential risk of CT or MR mischaracterization against the desire to gain information about cyst\\ngrowth using as few imaging studies as possible.\\n\\nRC607D\\n\\nClinical Challenges of Structured Ultrasound Reporting and Management of Adnexal Masses\\n\\nParticipants\\nBetty J.

With the continued improvement in gray-scale and color Doppler techniques and introduction of graded-compression\\nand advanced sonographic applications, the use of ultrasonography has increased in the evaluation of children with acute\\nabdominal pain with US becoming an invaluable imaging modality in the evaluation of pediatric abdominal emergencies. Ultrasound of\\nthe abdomen in children is typically a targeted exam; some of the emergent non-appendiceal indications include evaluation for\\npyloric stenosis, necrotizing enterocolitis, midgut volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, and intussusception. Acquired conditions\\nsuch as gallbladder pathology, splenomegaly, renal stones and pyelonephritis, bowel hematoma, abdominal infections and hernias\\ncan also be detected with ultrasound. Rare emergencies associated with abdominal neoplasms, vascular disorders and foreign\\nbodies may first be detected with sonography.\\n\\nRC608D\\n\\nUltrasound of Genitourinary and Gynecologic Emergencies\\n\\nParticipants\\nBarbara K.

Clinical history and physical examination may suggest endometriosis, but imaging mapping is necessary to\\nidentify the disease and mandatory for clinical couseling and surgical planning. Transvaginal ultrasound after bowel preparation is\\nthe best imaging modality as the first-line technique to evaluate patients suspected of endometriosis. The bowel preparation is\\nrelatively simple and includes the day before and the day of the examination. This method is highly accurate to identify intestinal\\nendometriosis and to determine which layers of the bowel wall are affected. In addition, it provides better assessment of small\\nperitoneal lesions of the retrocervical space, vagina and bladder. Pelvic adhesions can also be evaluated during the exam.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cRC611\\n\\nPET/MRI Update 2020\\n\\nMR NM\\n\\nFDA  Discussions may include off-label uses.\\n\\nParticipants\\nRathan M.

In 2018, a survey of over 15000\\nphysicians in 25 medical specialties showed that burnout among radiologists has climbed from the 18th to the 7th highest rate of\\nburnout amongst all physicians, since a previous survey performed in 2013 (1). Burnout in medicine can be detrimental to quality\\nand safety of patient care, and can lead to job dissatisfaction, decreased productivity, high physician turnover, and ultimately can\\ncontribute to physician shortages and increasing health care costs (2). Another critical consequence of burnout in medicine is the\\nimpact on physician mental health, with studies showing burnout associated with increased depression, substance abuse, and\\nsuicide in physicians (3). Although awareness of work-related stress in medicine has been present for decades, more recent\\nchanges to patterns of patient care through technological advances such as the electronic medical record (EMR) and Picture\\nArchiving and Communication Systems (PACS), have increased that burden of stress. These innovations have certainly improved\\naspects of patient care, however they have also contributed to two potential causes of burnout such as heightened sense of\\nisolation and sedentary work environments.

Measures of heterogeneity were used to test the hypothesis that heterogeneity can be used as predictor of\\nnodule malignancy and patient survival. To do this, we use the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset to determine if\\nheterogeneity can represent differences between nodules in lung cancer and nodules in non-lung cancer patients. 253 participants\\nare in the training set and 207 participants in the test set. To discriminate cancerous from non-cancerous nodules at the time of\\ndiagnosis, a combination of heterogeneity and radiomic features were evaluated to produce the best area under receiver operating\\ncharacteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.85 and accuracy 81.64%. Second, we tested the hypothesis that heterogeneity can predict\\npatient survival. We analyzed 40 patients diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma (20 short-term and 20 long-term survival patients)\\nusing a leave-one-out cross validation approach for performance evaluation. A combination of heterogeneity features and radiomic\\nfeatures produce an AUROC of 0.9 and an accuracy of 85% to discriminate long- and short-term survivors.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cRC654\\n\\nPatient-centric Radiology: How to Do It\\n\\nAI\\n\\nED HP\\n\\nIN\\n\\nParticipants\\nJames V.

However, the impressive advances in computational power and development of robust artificial intelligence (AI)\\napproaches and machine learning tools in the last decade have opened new horizons for the implementation and use of these tools\\nfor image analysis and quantitative biomarker development. In this lecture, the essentials of biomarker development using AI,\\nspecifically the subfield of machine learning, will be reviewed. The participant will be introduced to the major steps in development\\nof a prediction algorithm, focusing on feature extraction (image analysis) and predictive algorithm or classifier development. More\\ntraditional (non-AI) and AI approaches will be contrasted, including a discussion of their respective strengths and potential for\\ncombined use. The lecture will conclude with a brief discussion of use of AI for integration of multi-dimensional omics data\\nconsisting of image and non-image-based features.\\n\\nRC705C\\n\\nFlow and Metabolic Measurement in Cerebrovascular Disease\\n\\nParticipants\\nLaura B.

Often times, one\\'s identity can be the stimulus for harassment and microaggressions, which are amplified by\\nintersectionality when an individual belongs to more than one oppressed group. Harassment and microaggressions have been shown\\nto have an impact on mental health and well-being. Many groups are frequent recipients of microaggressions, including but not\\nlimited to, gender, race, class, sexual orientation, religion, and more. According to the 2019 Women in the Workforce study\\nconducted by LeanIn.org and McKinsey & Co, 73% of women reported experiencing microaggressions but only 1/3 of respondents\\nspoke up to challenge it2. Recognizing harassment - toward oneself or others - and taking action when it happens can be difficult\\nwithout a plan. Currently, the RSNA Annual Meeting lacks programming to address these specific, real workplace experiences that\\npermeate daily interactions. Providing RSNA members with tools to prevent or counteract microaggressions would be a valuable\\noffering.\\n\\nSub-Events\\n\\nRC716A\\n\\nWhat are Microaggressions?

Inviting patient\\nadvocates into event reviews may provide insights and solutions to complex situations.\\n\\nSub-Events\\n\\nRC722A\\n\\nIntroduction and Discussion of the Medical Physics Examples and Potential Solutions\\n\\nParticipants\\nMahadevappa Mahesh, PHD, Baltimore, MD (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nmmahesh@jhmi.edu\\n\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n1) To examine settings to ensure radiation incidents are avoided. 2) To develop plan of action for post radiation incident evaluaiton.\\n3) To reflect on the processes such as quality control and training.\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n\\nDefining radiation incidents in diagnostic imaging settings are key. Radiation incidents can lead to deterministic effects such as hair-\\nloss or skin erythema, which are rare but possible due to prolonged fluoroscopy procedures or CT scans (CT perfusion studies) due\\nto incorrect settings. Even though prevention is better and is achievable by routine review of equipment and protocol settings, but\\nwhen radiation incidents occur, a physicist can do the following. First, physicist should record details of scan settings that have led\\nto the radiation incident. Next, it is important to assess and make necessary changes to the scan settings to avoid future\\nincidents. This should be followed by detail assessment of radiation exposure to patients (skin dose and organ dose) and work with\\nthe radiologists and other physicians to address the radiation events. In addition, tasks including regulatory compliance, staff\\ntraining, and others will be discussed in this talk.\\n\\nRC722B\\n\\nDiscussion of Examples, Solutions and Tools\\n\\nParticipants\\nKimberly E.

PET is highly sensitive, thus, requiring only small amounts of biomarkers to be used for visualization\\nand quantification purposes. By comparison to high-resolution anatomical images PET images appear blurred, which is attributed to\\nthe positron range effects and the limited detector size of the PET ring systems.Today, clinical PET imaging systems are offered\\nalmost exclusively in combination with CT and MR systems. Combined PET/MR, in particular, offers a number of intrinsic\\nmethodological advantages over PET only. These include, the use of MR imaging (e.g., by means of MR navigators) to estimate\\ninvoluntary patient motion as a pre-requisite for motion compensation, and, thus, subsequent improvement of PET image quality\\nand quantification. Following appropriate motion compensation, PET data can be improved in quality and accuracy through the use\\nof MR-guided partial volume corrections and image reconstruction. In this presentation we will highlight the most important\\nadvances of PET instrumentation and data processing that help facilitate fully-integrated PET/MR in the first place, and draw a\\nbenefit from this integration for the PET data. This includes a brief discussion of the effect of the static MR field on positron range\\neffects, in particular for higher-energetic positron emitters. Overall, increase volume sensitivity helps reduce the amount of\\nradiotracer injected into patients or shorten the emission scan time, in combination with increased signal-to-noise in the emission\\nimages (thanks to the use of time-of-flight, a concept different from TOF-MR) it helps increase sensitivity and reader accuracy of\\nPET images. Lastly, advances in image reconstruction have brought the level of PET, and the appearance of the PET images, closer\\nto the common understanding of radiologically useful images.\\n\\n\\x0cRC821C\\n\\nSPECT/CT Quantitation\\n\\nParticipants\\nSrinivas C.

Hence, it is\\nevident that AI will re-define all aspects of the radiology profession by making radiologists better and faster in what they do. The\\nrecent AI hype, however, has led to unrealistic promises on how fast we might see such changes in clinical practice, or even see\\nradiologists replaced by machines. Yet, the perceived mismatch between such inflated expectations and the negligible impact and\\nlimited visibility of AI solutions in current radiology has led to a broad disillusionment among many clinical radiologists about the\\nrelevance of AI for their daily practice. Facing this situation, it is time to re-establish credibility in the field and systematically\\naddress unsolved both scientific and practical challenges for successful adoption of AI in radiology, which will be reviewed in this\\npresentation. Here, scientific challenges include current limitations of machine learning, pertaining to explainable artificial\\nintelligence, machine-supported image annotation, effective human-machine complementarity, and unsupervised data exploration.\\nPractical challenges include cost-effectiveness analysis of AI, validation of relevant performance measures, such as diagnostic\\naccuracy and turnaround times, and the definition of clinically meaningful patient outcome measures for AI in prospective clinical\\ntrials. This session will review these current limitations to adoption of AI in radiology and will present strategies to overcome them\\nfrom multiple perspectives, including clinical, scientific, and industry viewpoints.\\n\\nSub-Events\\n\\nRC853A\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence in Radiology: Challenges and Opportunities\\n\\nParticipants\\nAxel Wismueller, MD,PhD, Pittsford, NY (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n1) Learn about fundamental challenges and opportunities of artificial intelligence in radiology. 2) Review scientific challenges of\\ncontemporary machine learning. 3) Review methods for explainable artificial intelligence in radiology. 4) Define practical bottlenecks\\nfor adoption of AI in clinical practice. 5) Identify novel methods to address such challenges. 6) Learn about current clinical\\napplications of AI in radiology.\\n\\nRC853B\\n\\nTackling the Challenges of Next Generation Healthcare\\n\\nParticipants\\nHolger R.

Machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence (AI), has improved\\nthe ability to detect image features, make diagnoses, and assess prognosis from image data. Radiomics - which generates high-\\ndimensionality datasets from radiology images - provides insights to support precision medicine. Novel approaches have improved\\nsharing of images and image-derived findings with patients and clinicians. Current research efforts go beyond pixel data to integrate\\nimaging with other biomedical data, standardize imaging workflows, and improve the quality and utility of image-derived information\\nin clinical practice.

Traditional vascular phantoms are made from one material and they are a simplification of the\\npatient anatomy. They model one artery, rarely included branching arteries and the arterial wall mechanical properties are not\\nproperly modeled. In addition, inclusion of pathologies such as atherosclerotic plaques or surrounding anatomical structures is\\npractically inexistent. New advancements in multi-material 3D printing allow development of phantoms replicating complex vascular\\nsystems and vascular disease which can mimic mechanical properties of the vessels and physiological aspects of the blood flow. In\\nthis presentation we will describe how to design comprhensive vascular phantoms which includes significant distal vasculature and\\nvascular lesions such as atherosclerotic plaques and aneurysms. We will review various uses of the patient specific vascular\\nphantoms for treatment planning of vascular diseases such as abdominal aortic aneurysms with the Fenestrated Endo Vascular\\nAortic Repair device. We will show how significant surgery outcome improvement may be achieved in patients undergoing pre-\\ntreatment simulation using patient specific phantoms.\\n\\nRCC33E\\n\\n3D Printing in Urologic Oncology\\n\\nParticipants\\nNicole Wake, PhD, Bronx, NY (Presenter) Consultant, General Electric CompanyIn-kind support, Stratasys, Ltd\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cRCC34\\n\\nDecision Support and Implications for Federal Regulations (PAMA): What You Need to Know and Do\\n\\nIN\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: 1.00\\n\\nParticipants\\nRamin Khorasani, MD, Roxbury Crossing, MA (Moderator) Nothing to Disclose\\nAli Raja, MD, MBA, Brookline, MA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nKeith D.

While this will mature into a reliable and robust\\ninfrastructure, currently no one has meaningful experience using such machines for patient care at scale. This gives rise to\\nconsiderable potential for errors with high consequences. 2) Realize that your radiology data are extremely valuable for commercial\\npurposes. Understand how to control access to those data, and to make your enterprise aware. 3) Recognize different types of\\nbias in radiology data. 4) Appreciate ethical issues for machine learning and AI in radiology. 5) Understand unique aspects of\\ntransparency, fairness, and privacy when using AI in radiology.\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n\\nIt is challenging to use decision-making AI machines in radiology situations that previously could only be done by humans. AI offers\\ngreat promise but comes with numerous potential pitfalls, and is inevitably biased to some degree. Radiologists have a duty to\\nunderstand the benefits and risks of AI agents they use, to alert patients and stakeholders to potential pitfalls as appropriate, and\\nto monitor AI products to guard against harm. While this will undoubtedly mature into a reliable and robust infrastructure, currently\\nwe lack meaningful experience using such machines for patient care at scale. This gives rise to considerable potential for errors\\nwith high consequences.Because developing AI driven machines today requires massive amounts of well labeled radiology data, the\\nvalue of those data is skyrocketing and the drive to provide commercial access to radiology data will become overwhelming.\\nCurrently how to allow, manage, and contract for that data access is evolving at a rate which outstrips our current knowledge or\\nabilities. We are at risk of making expensive and calamitous mistakes with radiology data.In addition to the significant good which\\nwill come from using these data to make better predictions and improve patient health, the opportunity unquestionably exists to\\nobtain incredibly significant additional income by using these data in unethical ways which may harm patients, other cohorts, or the\\ncommon good. Limiting radiology AI to ethical uses means leaving a massive amount of money on the table. One of our greatest\\nchallenges is how to thwart those who will attempt to acquire this value.Patients, radiologists, and other cohorts in the radiology\\ncommunity are at risk of being engulfed by digital surveillance and categorized and manipulated by intelligent and autonomous\\nmachines.AI has dramatically altered our perception of radiology examinations and associated data --- their value, how to use them\\nand how they may be misused. As much as understanding AI, radiologists have a moral duty both to understand their data, and to\\nuse the data they collect to improve the common good, extract more information about patients and their diseases, and improve\\nthe practice of radiology.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cRCC43\\n\\nAdvanced Cinematic Rendering\\n\\nIN\\n\\nParticipants\\nElliot K.

It is time to move to internet exchange so that images\\ncan safely and securely be moved as easily as we move movies, photos and music. Modern standards based technologies can be\\nemployed to accomplish this goal. Such technologies include IHE, DICOM, DICOMweb,and HL7 FHIR. Workflow is an important\\nconsideration and should drive the implementation of these technologies Early solutions will be described as well as how one might\\nextend these solutions to other healthcare data.

An imaging practice that desires to follow the ALARA principle and produce\\nhigh-quality images should have standardized protocols across their enterprise. Accreditation standards require a periodic review of\\nall scanner protocols. However, variations among vendors, models, and clinical indications mean that managing and optimizing\\ndozens of parameters for each protocol on every scanner in a health system is challenging. Even when variations between systems\\nare limited, managing protocol names and parameters across multiple systems can be difficult. The purpose of this symposium is to\\nidentify tools and techniques that may be used to manage protocols across multiple systems and to provide a framework for\\nprotocol optimization.\\n\\nSub-Events\\n\\nRCC55A\\n\\nOverview of CT Protocol Parameters and Protocol Management Pitfalls\\n\\nParticipants\\nKevin Little, PhD, Columbus, OH (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n1) Recognize the practical and regulatory requirements for protocol management. 2) Identify the technical and clinical parameters\\nthat may be included as part of a CT protocol. 3) Understand common difficulties in managing protocols across system vendors,\\nmodels, and geographic locations.\\n\\nRCC55B\\n\\nAvailable Methods, Strategies, and Tools for CT Protocol Management\\n\\nParticipants\\nTimothy P.

The concept groups together phases of\\nindication requiring similiar: levels of image quality, body regions, scan times, and contrast enhancement. Once grouped, \\'master\\'\\nacquisition parameters can be defined for each master protocol. We will show how this simplifies protocol management across a\\ndiverse fleet of CT scanners. In other words, it changes a three phase abdomen CTA protocol from being thought of as composed\\nof three unique sets of acqusition parameters into: abdomen CTA master, then 2 phases using the routine abdomen master. We will\\nalso apply the same concept to reconstruction parameters. This allows the creation, for example, of identical lung field images\\nacross any protocol imaging the chest whether it is a dedicated thoracic protocol or a gated chest CTA. Lastly, we will survey\\ncurrent commerical and custom solutions for protocol management. The goal of the survey will be to inform the attendee on what\\noptions exsist today to guide their selection of such a producitivity/complainace informatics solution.\\n\\nRCC55C\\n\\nDetails and Features of DICOM Protocol Storage and the IHE Management of Acquisition Protocols\\n(MAP) Profile\\n\\nParticipants\\nKevin O\\'Donnell, Pacifica, CA (Presenter) Employee, Canon Medical Systems Corporation\\n\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n1) Understand the protocol execution and management capabilities enabled by DICOM Protocol Storage objects. 2) Understand the\\nprotocol management architecture defined in the IHE MAP Profile. 3) Learn how to request standards-based protocol features in\\nproducts.\\n\\n\\x0cPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSPCP31\\n\\nThailand Presents\\n\\nOT\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credits ™: 2.00\\n\\nSub-Events\\n\\nSPCP31A\\n\\nTo Perform MRI Spine in Thailand: What to Keep in Mind\\n\\nParticipants\\nSuphaneewan Jaovisidha, MD, Bangkok, Thailand (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n1) To develop an idea regarding certain common diseases in Thailand that may be encountered in spinal MR imaging and included\\nareas. 2) Apply appropriate imaging signs/findings to differentiate such conditions from other.\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n\\nSpinal MR imaging is performed worldwide due to many diseases involving this structure.

Teaching hospitals and radiology faculty have done a tremendous job in\\nadapting to these highly unusual circumstances, turning to online or virtual platforms as novel teaching aids. Residency programs\\nhave primarily responded to the pandemic by transitioning to virtual teaching rounds, allowing residents to work from home, and\\nconducting readouts virtually (73%). These platforms have their pros and cons. They are convenient and accessible, saving\\ncommuting time thereby increasing clinical productivity. Because the connections in these platforms are two way, interactive case\\nbased conferences and readout sessions can be mimicked, with both trainee and mentor seeing the images simultaneously.\\nPrograms such as poll everywhere, RSNA Diagnosis Live and Kahoot enable active learning through audience participation and even\\nhand-raising function. Still, there is value in active and personal side-by-side teaching of trainees at the workstation, which has\\nbeen shown to be the most critical component in the education of future Radiologists. The benefits of the face-to-face encounter\\ncannot be emphasized enough, in which relationships develop and both parties engage not just with verbal communication and tone\\nof voice but also body language and facial expressions. Several virtual platforms are now available, three of the most popular in\\nradiology being Zoom, Cisco Webex and Microsoft Teams. Each has their own advantages and disadvantages. Armed with these\\nnew tools, a shift in radiology education is beginning. Some conferences and meetings have switched to an all-virtual platform,\\nincluding the RSNA. Who knows if more radiologists will prefer the virtual option in the future, with the convenience and flexibility\\nthat it brings, and best of all, the option to read out in our pajamas. Fortunately, previous investigations have concluded that\\nthese platforms have not significantly resulted in an overall decline in trainee education and knowledge. However, the traditional\\nside-by-side readout, central to radiology education, must not be totally abandoned, and should be progressively re-introduced,\\nalong with the easing of social restriction measures. For now, it is imperative that we prioritize safety by sticking to our pajames,\\nwhile keeping in mind that social interaction and supporting each other, online or offline, enhances the development and\\nadvancement of our specialty.\\n\\nSub-Events\\n\\nSPFF31A\\n\\nInternational Medical Graduates in Radiology: Challenges & Opportunities\\n\\nParticipants\\nGeorge K.

Like most of you, I have spent\\nthe last few months talking to thumbnails.This image looks familiar, right ?The pandemic that began in December 2019 has upended\\nradiologists\\' lives. The CDC\\'s recommendation for social distancing has effectively knocked out in-person conferences, side-by-side\\nreadouts, altered clinical schedules and rotations, postponed certifying examinations, and delayed research activities.Social\\ndistancing meant up to 50% drop in the volume of elective imaging, which also adversely affected case mix diversity.As my previous\\ncolleagues have shown, radiology faculty and trainees have done a tremendous job in adapting, turning to online platforms as novel\\nteaching aids, allowing residents to work from home and for readouts to be conducted virtually.These platforms have their pros and\\ncons. Overall, they are convenient and accessible, saving precious commuting time and potentially increasing clinical productivity.\\nBecause the connections in these platforms are two way, interactive case based conferences and readout sessions can be\\nmimicked, with both trainee and mentor seeing the images simultaneously. More recent programs enable active learning through\\naudience participation and even hand-raising function.On the other hand, some of these platforms continue to be plagued by\\nsecurity concerns, and working them out does involve a bit of a learning curve. Furthermore, based on recent surveys, there is\\nconcern for the loss of personal side-by-side teaching of trainees at the workstation, a mainstay in the education of future\\nradiologists. Feelings of isolation, reduced camaraderie, and loss of non-verbal feedback including body language and facial\\nexpressions are also worrisome. `This is not the first time that radiology education has been challenged by emerging technologies or\\nhighly unusual circumstances. The noon conference teaching method known as the hot seat conference, is both interactive and\\nstressful. It is the original, the classic, the Godfather radiology teaching method that is film and case-based, whose origins are\\nunclear. It is just the way we have always done things. Radiology education was also drastically changed by the invention of the\\npersonal computer, paving the way for the digital age. The 1970s gave rise to PACS, increasing workflow and reducing operational\\ncosts. Education-wise, it resulted in large collections of teaching files and applications, making e-learning or filmless education what\\nit is today. The artist formerly known as the overhead projector was superseded by Powerpoint in the 1990s. As the volume of data\\nincreased, education transformed from being learner-centered to being instructor-centered, as focus shifted towards the delivery\\nof information rather than the learner\\'s thought process. The 2000s gave birth to a giant baby known as social media. Between the\\n2011 and 2012 RSNA meetings, the use of Twitter increased by at least 30% with most educators leveraging this technology to\\nengage attendees and promote collaboration. We have been doing online teaching since March, possibly the longest time that\\neducators have had to do so. In some institutions, even with more relaxed social distancing measures, most rounds are still\\nconducted online, and I must admit, I am getting used to talking to thumbnails. The RSNA this year will be completely virtual, and\\nwho knows whether most people will prefer this option in the future.Fortunately, recent published data have shown that these\\nplatforms have not adversely affected trainee education and are generally well-accepted by residents. However, there is a call from\\nsome groups that the traditional side-by-side readout should be gradually and progressively re-introduced, along with the easing of\\nsocial restriction measures.It cannot be denied that radiology education is facing another major transformation due to the\\npandemic, and nobody knows for certain what the next few months will bring. But whether seated side by side or facing each other\\nscreen to screen, radiology education will continue to evolve, as it always has. Change is inevitable. In fact, only 1 thing is\\nconstant and it is a theme that you heard during this entire session: visionary medicine will always require human insights.

While CT is the most\\ncommonly used imaging modality for acute stroke imaging, MRI remains the most accurate modality for detection of acute\\ninfarction. In this presentation we will review the role of MRI in screening and treatment planning of acute stroke patients as relate\\nto thrombolysis and endovascular thrombectomy. Recent clinical trials will be reviewed and treatment guidelines according to the\\nlatest American Heart Association (AHA)/American Stroke Association (ASA) guidelines will be discussed. We will also highlight how\\nan effective MRI workflow can be configured in the setting of acute stroke imaging.\\n\\nSPSH20D\\n\\nImaging of Cerebral Edema: An Up-and-Coming Target?\\n\\nParticipants\\nRuediger von Kummer, MD, Dresden, Germany (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\n\\x0cruediger.vonkummer@ukdd.de\\n\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n1) To learn how to predict malignant edema on imaging. 2) To learn about new therapeutics targeting the edema in stroke patients.\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n\\nWithin the first 6 hours of ischemic stroke onset, CT or MRI cannot detect histological changes indicating brain tissue infarction,\\nbecause signs of tissue death are extremely subtle and hard to detect even with a microscope under experimental conditions. In\\nthis acute phase of ischemic stroke, the degree of regional ischemia triggers two types of tissue water content changes. Below a\\ncerebral blood flow (CBF) of 30 ml/100gxmin the extracellular space shrinks and cells swell due to a shift of water molecules from\\nthe extracellular to the intracellular space (cellular edema). Diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) is highly sensitive to detect brain tissue\\nwith cellular edema and thus the pattern of brain tissue suffering from moderate to severe ischemia. Extended cellular edema\\npredicts the development of space-occupying vasogenic edema with life-threatening mass effects (malignant edema). Pure cellular\\nedema is not associated with net water uptake, thus does not affect the tissue\\'s x-ray attenuation, and cannot be detected with\\nCT. Ion depletion in the extracellular space triggers, however, net water uptake from capillaries with some rest-flow through special\\nendothelium channels that can be blocked with low-dose glibenclamide. This edema type was called \"ionic\" and is observed in brain\\ntissue with a CBF < 20 ml/100gxmin only, a threshold below which brain tissue cannot survive for more than 30 min. Ionic brain\\nedema is thus a marker of irreversible ischemic injury. Because brain tissue water content correlates with tissue radiodensity, CT\\ncan detect and quantify ionic edema thus identifying tissue that is unlikely to recover and monitoring therapeutic interventions to\\nreduce ionic edema.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSPSH40\\n\\nHot Topic Session: Artificial Intelligence and Implications for Health Equity: Will AI Improve Equity or\\nIncrease Disparities?\\n\\nTuesday, Dec. 1 3:30PM - 4:30PM Room: Channel 2\\n\\nAI\\n\\nIN\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: 1.00\\n\\nParticipants\\nJudy W.

These changes can be estimated with positron emission tomography (PET)\\nand cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assays of beta-amyloid (ab42) and tau. PET and CSF biomarkers of AD have been validated\\nsufficiently in the scientific literature such that a Biomarker Framework has been proposed for defining and staging AD during life.\\nThis is pertinent because AD has a prolonged pre-symptomatic phase (twenty years or more) during which secondary prevention\\napproaches may be tested/applied if the disease can be confidently identified. In this talk the relative utility of PET and CSF\\nbiomarkers for AD will be presented, with particular emphasis on biomarker changes during the prolonged pre-symptomatic phase of\\nthe disease. We will review the spatiotemporal patterns of each modality and discuss new evidence that the onset age of the\\namyloid component of AD can be estimated with amyloid PET imaging. Finally we will review the predictive relationship between AD\\nbiomarkers and cognitive decline, where new evidence suggests that a longer duration (or chronicity) and greater abundance of AD\\nproteinopathy is associated with a greater risk of cognitive decline.\\n\\nSPSH52B\\n\\nBeyond Amyloid and Tau: Biofluids Biomarkers to Profile the Heterogeneous Drivers of Decline in\\nAlzheimer\\'s Disease and Related Disorders\\n\\nParticipants\\nSteven E.

Infection has been reported in\\nmost countries around the world, and by August 15th there have been over 21 million cases of COVID-19 reported worldwide with\\nover 700,000 COVID-19-associated deaths. It has become apparent that, although COVID-19 predominately affects the respiratory\\nsystem, many other organ systems can also be involved. Imaging plays an essential role in the diagnosis of all manifestations of the\\ndisease as well as its related complications, and proper utilization and interpretation of imaging studies is crucial. With the growing\\nglobal COVID-19 outbreak, a comprehensive understanding of the diagnostic imaging hallmarks, imaging features, multisystem\\ninvolvement, and evolution of imaging findings is essential for effective patient management and treatment. In this session the key\\nimaging features of the varied pathological manifestations of this infection involving the abdomen and pelvis will be discussed.\\n\\nSPSH54B\\n\\nPediatric Manifestations\\n\\nParticipants\\nEdward Y.

Utilize abnormalities on CXR and CT scan to diagnose Covid-19 related lung conditions 2. Utilize patterns of CT abnormalities to\\ndecide about therapeutic options 3. Using imaging modalities to predict long term functional and exercise limitations in patients with\\nCovid-19 related lung disease\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n\\nLung abnormalities are commonly seen in patients with Covid-19 who develop respiratory symptoms. It is important to be familiar\\nwith these patterns of disease, which include ground glass opacities, dense consolidation, reticulation and traction bronchiectasis.\\nUpto 30 % of these patients may develop superadded bacterial or fungal infections. Since some patients with hypoxemic respiratory\\nfailure require intubation and mechanical ventilation, frequent review of these patients\\' CXR may help delineate the presence of\\nbarotrauma. These abnormalities may also help to decide if medications such as remdesivir and systemic steroids should be given.\\nAssessing these abnormalities may also allow clinicians to decide what the long term prognosis may be. Finally, in some patients\\nwith hypoxemic respiratory failure and paucity of pulmonary opacities, thromboembolic disease may be suspected.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSPSH57\\n\\nHot Topic Session: Department Readiness for Disasters-Lessons Learned from COVID\\n\\nThursday, Dec. 3 3:30PM - 4:30PM Room: Channel 2\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: 1.00\\n\\nParticipants\\nMahmud Mossa-Basha, MD, Seattle, WA (Moderator) Nothing to Disclose\\nBien Soo Tan, FRCR,MBBS, Singapore, Singapore (Moderator) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nSub-Events\\n\\nSPSH57A\\n\\nDepartment Considerations for the Inpatient Setting\\n\\nParticipants\\nMichael S.

Transformational change in radiology education through the RSNA is necessary to address health disparities, increase access to\\nhigh-quality radiology care, and achieve equity. However, educational curricula in health equity, social determinants of health, and\\ndisparities are lacking at national radiology meetings. Through the \\'Health Equity Matters: An interactive session on health\\ndisparities and equity\\' the RSNA can continue to be the leader in innovative radiology education and address this radiology\\neducation gap. This course will be composed of renowned radiology leaders in health disparities and health equity. 2. This\\neducational session offers a unique opportunity to improve the knowledge of the audience and improve access to radiology care to\\nour increasingly diverse population through a series of innovative, short lectures and an interactive panel discussion about social\\ndeterminants of health, health disparities and equity in radiology. The purpose of this course is to provide the audience with an\\neducational primer to gain a deeper understanding of health disparities in radiology and to provide the audience with tools to\\nincrease access to radiology services and achieve health equity. 3. A series of short educational lectures (10 minutes each) will be\\nfollowed by a 10-minute Q&A interactive panel discussion with the audience. This interactive panel discussion will engage the\\naudience in active discussion of topics relevant to their practice, address specific questions that arise during the sessions, and\\ndiscuss relevant topics not addressed during the lectures.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSPSI25\\n\\nSpecial Interest Session: Improving Patient Experience through Human Design Thinking (Sponsored by the\\nRSNA Public Information Committee)\\n\\nFriday, Dec. 4 8:30AM - 9:30AM Room: Channel 2\\n\\nLM\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: 1.00\\n\\nParticipants\\nSusan D.

In the\\npast year‚ there continue to be basic developments in radiology‚ as well as new guidelines and clinical trials in imaging that affect\\nyour practice. Overall trends for new scientific studies reflect an increasing number of clinical trials being submitted from around the\\nworld in addition to those of North America. Publications from Europe have been prominent in recent years‚ but new research\\nprograms from countries such as Japan‚ South Korea and China are developing quickly. Large numbers of study subjects in clinical\\ntrials are now common‚ and tends to result in more robust demonstration of the efficacy of imaging interventions. Artificial\\nintelligence applications are becoming commonplace in our publications‚ as are radiomics studies with increasing large numbers of\\nstudy subjects. Publications assessing the COVID19 pandemic have resulted new knowledge regarding the use of imaging. This\\nseminar will highlight the results of key publications in the past year that are most likely to affect your practice in the near future‚\\nas well as presenting novel topics that are likely to be important to the field over the next 5 years.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSPSP21\\n\\nInteligencia Artificial IA y Radiomica Donde estamos?-Sesión del Colegio Interamericano de Radiología (CIR)\\nen Español/Artificial Intelligence AI and Radiomics.

Of the 964 patients, 665 (69.0 %) had undergone preoperative breast MR imaging (MR group) and 299 (31.0%) had\\nnot (No MR group). We calculated the MR detection rate of additional suspicious lesions that were occult at mammography and\\nultrasonography and analyzed any changes in surgical management. Surgical outcomes were compared with the use of inverse\\nprobability weighting (IPW) to adjust 19 possible confounding factors regarding to patient demographics, clinical features, and\\ntumor characteristics and create a balance between groups with and without MR imaging.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nOf the 665 patients who underwent MR imaging, additional suspicious lesions were detected in 178 patients (26.8 %), with 88 of\\nthe 178 (49.4 %) being malignant. Surgical plan was changed in 99 of the 665 patients (14.9 %) due to MR findings. According to\\npathologic results, this change was appropriate for 62 of the 99 patients (62.6 %). In the IPW analysis, breast MR imaging was\\nassociated with lower odds of repeat surgery (odds ratio= 0.126, p<0.001) and positive resection margin (odds ratio= 0.324,\\np<0.001). The MR group showed higher odds of initial mastectomy (odds ratio=1.615, p=0.004), but there was no difference in\\noverall mastectomy (odds ratio=1.235, p=0.173) compared to the no MR group.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nPreoperative MR imaging in young age breast cancer patients is useful for detecting additional synchronous malignancy and also\\nimproving the surgical outcomes by significantly reducing the rate of repeat surgery and positive resection margin, with a similar\\nlikelihood of overall mastectomy.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nBreast cancers in young women are rare, but known to have poor prognosis than older women. Preoperative MR imaging was\\nassociated with favorable surgical outcomes in these patients qualified for the surgical treatment.\\n\\nSSBR03-02 Characterization of Breast Cancer Subtypes by Quantitative Assessment of Intratumoral\\n\\nHeterogeneity using Dynamic Contrast-enhanced and Diffusion-weighted MR Imaging\\n\\nParticipants\\nJin Joo Kim, MD, Busan, Korea, Republic Of (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nJin You Kim, MD, Busan, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nSuk Kim, MD, Pusan, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nyoudosa@naver.com\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo investigate whether intratumoral heterogeneity assessed with dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-\\nMRI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) provides information related to molecular subtypes of invasive breast cancers.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nConsecutive 221 women (mean age, 55.1 years) with invasive breast cancer who underwent preoperative DCE-MRI with DWI were\\n\\n\\x0cretrospectively evaluated between July 2019 and February 2020. To evaluate intratumoral heterogeneity of each breast cancer,\\nthe kinetic heterogeneity (a measure of heterogeneity in the proportions of tumor pixels with delayed washout, plateau, and\\npersistent components within a tumor) was assessed with DCE-MRI using a commercially available CAD system. In addition, the\\napparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) were measured using a region of interest technique and the ADC heterogeneity index was\\ncalculated using the following formula; (ADC max -ADC min) / ADC mean. The possible associations between imaging-based\\nheterogeneity values for breast cancer and tumor subtypes were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U test and receiver operating\\ncharacteristic (ROC) curves.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nOf the 221 breast cancers, 36 (16.3 %) were classified as luminal A tumors, 139 (62.9 %) as luminal B tumors, 24 (10.9 %) as\\nHER2-enriched tumors, and 22 (10.0 %) as triple-negative tumors. Non-luminal tumors showed higher kinetic heterogeneity value\\nthan non-luminal tumors (median, 0.92 [interquartile range (IQR) 0.82, 0.97] versus 0.76 [0.38, 0.93], P < 0.001). The kinetic\\nheterogeneity yielded area under the ROC (Az) of 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63, 0.76) for differentiating luminal from\\nnon-luminal tumors. Triple-negative tumors exhibited both higher kinetic heterogeneity and higher ADC heterogeneity values than\\nnon-triple-negative tumors (0.90 [0.75, 0.98] vs. 0.80 [0.44, 0.94], P = 0.011; 0.99 [0.84, 1.19] vs. 0.75 [0.57, 1.01], P = 0.003;\\nrespectively). HER2-enriched tumors exhibited higher kinetic heterogeneity value, but lower ADC heterogeneity value as compared\\nto non-HER2-enriched tumors (0.94 [0.83, 0.96] vs. 0.79 [0.43, 0.93], P = 0.003; 0.63 [0.45, 0.93] vs. 0.81 [0.61, 1.05], P =\\n0.027; respectively). However, no significant differences were noted in these values between luminal A and luminal B tumors (P =\\n0.675 and 0.567, respectively).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nAssessment of heterogeneity of enhancement kinetics and ADC values might provide biological information related to molecular\\nsubtypes of breast cancers.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nIntratumoral heterogeneity assessment with DCE-MRI and DWI could help to characterize the molecular subtype of breast cancer.\\n\\nSSBR03-03 Ultrafast Breast MRI Improves the Discrimination of Benign from Malignant Breast Lesions\\n\\nParticipants\\nShalin Patel, MD, Hershey, PA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nLinda H.

All patients underwent a bi-temporal MRI that included ultrafast time-resolved angiography with stochastic\\ntrajectory (TWIST) DCE-MRI followed by a conventional volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE) DCE-MRI. Ultrafast\\nimaging was continuously acquired over 70 secs (temporal resolution, 4.5 secs) beginning at the start of the contrast injection.\\nConventional post-contrast VIBE imaging was performed till approximately 6 minutes after the injection of gadolinium. Time-to-\\nenhancement (TTE) derived from TWIST series along with conventional MRI features and clinicopathologic features to differentiate\\nbenign from malignant lesions. Statistical analysis was performed using Chi-square test and Mann-Whitney U-tests.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nAmong 392 patients, there were 430 biopsy-proven breast lesions [163 (37.9%) malignancies and 267 (62.1%) benign lesions]. The\\nmedian TTE of malignancies was shorter than that of benign lesions (p < 0.01). The addition of ultrafast imaging led to a\\nsignificantly higher specificity of conventional DCE-MRI (58.3% vs 74.7%, p=0.03) without significant difference in the sensitivity\\n(96.2% vs 97.3%, p = 0.67) for all lesions that were assessed as BI-RADS 4 and 5. TTE had a significantly better discriminative\\nability than curve type for masses, NME and foci (p<0.001, p<0.02 and p=0.045, respectively). Sub-analysis demonstrated that\\ncompared with conventional DCE-MRI, ultrafast imaging had higher sensitivity in women less than 50 years old (98.1% vs. 93.4%\\np=0.42, and women with minimal to mild BPE, compared with moderate to marked BPE (97.8 vs. 90.2 p=0.38).p=.038).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nTime-to-enhancement derived from ultrafast DCE-MRI was useful in differentiating between breast carcinomas and benign lesions.\\nIt had a higher diagnostic accuracy than conventional delayed kinetic curve types.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nTime-to-enhancement derived from ultrafast TWIST acquisitions allowed differentiation between malignant and benign breast\\nlesions.\\n\\n\\x0cSSBR03-04 Performance of Preoperative MRI to Evaluate Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS) in the ECOG-ACRIN\\n\\nE4112 Multicenter Trial\\n\\nParticipants\\nShinnhuey S.

In this\\nprespecified secondary analysis of the ECOG-ACRIN E4112 trial, we report the relation between baseline clinical covariates (e.g.,\\ntumor grade, histologic type, mammographic size), MRI features, and the DCIS score and MRI accuracy to evaluate extent of\\ndisease.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nE4112 was a prospective, nonrandomized multicenter trial of women with core needle biopsy (CNB)-diagnosed pure DCIS who were\\ncandidates for breast conservation surgery (BCS). All women underwent pMRI, and site radiologists recorded BI-RADS features and\\nsize of index DCIS, background parenchymal enhancement (BPE) level, and need for additional biopsies. DCIS grade and ER status\\non CNB and surgical specimens, along with final surgical pathology, were recorded. Women with BCS-confirmed pure DCIS received\\na 12-gene DCIS score. This secondary analysis evaluated DCIS size on MRI vs. mammography, MRI performance to identify\\nadditional disease, and associations of imaging features (lesion size, morphology, MRI BPE) with final pathology and DCIS Score.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe analysis set included 339 women with CNB-diagnosed DCIS (54 low, 136 intermediate, 137 high grade, 12 unknown). Median\\nMRI size of DCIS was larger than mammographic size (19 vs 12 mm, p<0.001). The majority of index DCIS were non-mass\\nenhancement (195/339) on MRI with minimal/mild BPE (236/339). MRI prompted additional CNBs in 19.8% (66/333; 6 missing) of\\nwomen and identified 5 additional contralateral cancers and 16 additional ipsilateral cancers for an exam-level additional cancer\\nyield of 6.3% (21/333), PPV of 31.8% (21/66), and false positive rate (biopsy with no additional malignancy) of 13.5% (45/333). No\\nqualitative imaging feature was associated with final nuclear grade, upgrade to invasive disease, or DCIS Score (p>0.05).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIn this secondary analysis of data from a multicenter study, pMRI identified a larger DCIS span than mammography, prompted\\nadditional biopsies in 1 in 5 women, and identified additional malignancy in 6%. Qualitative MRI features provided little value for\\npredicting final pathology and genomic outcomes.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nPreoperative MRI for DCIS often identifies a larger span of disease than mammography and additional malignancy in 6% of women.\\nQualitative MRI features had no association with pathology and genomic outcomes, suggesting a focus for radiomics.\\n\\nSSBR03-05 Eliminating Gadolinium-based Contrast Agents in Breast MRI Follow-up of BIRADS-3 Lesions\\n\\nParticipants\\nSarah Eskreis-Winkler, MD, New York, NY (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nJeffrey S.

We hypothesize that if a lesion is unchanged/resolved on T2w, it will\\nfollow a similar pattern on DCE-MRI. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether GBCA can be eliminated from 6-month follow-up\\nMRIs of BI-RADS 3 lesions without changing management recommendations.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nIn this retrospective study, breast MRIs classified as BIRADS-3 during 2017 were reviewed. BIRADS-3 lesions with T2 correlates\\nwere included. Three readers independently reviewed the initial BIRADS 3 exam and the T2w from the 6-month follow-up. Readers\\nrecorded each lesion\\'s size as increased or not increased and assigned a BIRADS-3 (short term imaging follow-up) or BIRADS-4\\n(suspicious--biopsy recommended). Readers were blinded to all MRI sequences on 6-month follow-up except T2w. After a 2-week\\nwashout period, readers independently reviewed the full MRI from the 6-month follow-up, recorded each lesion\\'s size on DCE-MRI as\\n\\n\\x0cincreased or not increased, and again assigned a BIRADS classification. Consensus readings were created by averaging the results\\nof individual readers. The switch rate (i.e. how often BIRADS recommendations changed with DCE-MRI) and kappa statistic (to\\nevaluate agreement between T2w and DCE-MRI) were calculated.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\n54 (20%) of 266 BIRADS-3 breast MRIs demonstrated a T2 correlate. Switch rate between BIRADS 3 and BIRADS 4 using T2w alone\\nversus DCE-MRI was 1.96% (CI 0.05,10.44), which is less than the 2% malignancy rate of the BIRADS-3 category. There was\\nexcellent agreement between lesion size increase on T2w and DCE-MRI (κ=0.85; ρ<0.001).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nFor BIRADS-3 lesions with T2 correlates undergoing 6-month breast MRI follow-up, management recommendations made using NCB-\\nMRI versus DCE-MRI were the same in >98%, suggesting that GBCA may be eliminated in this subset of exams.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nPreliminary data indicate 6-month follow-up with NCB-MRI for BIRADS-3 lesions with T2 correlates may be considered without\\nclinically significant changes in management recommendations.\\n\\nSSBR03-06 Clinical Utility of DWI for Detection of Clinically Occult Early Breast Cancer Including DCIS in the\\n\\nAsymptomatic Women\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Fellow\\n\\nParticipants\\nChae Woon Lee, MD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nHee Jung Shin, MD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nKi Chang Shin, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nWoo Jung Choi, MD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nEun Young Chae, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJoo Hee Cha, MD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nHak Hee Kim, MD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\ndocshin@amc.seoul.kr\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo investigate the clinical utility of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to detect clinically occult early breast cancer (EBC) including\\nductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and to compare the performance of mammography, DWI, and dynamic contrast-enhanced breast\\nMRI (DCE-MRI).\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nFrom June 2018 to January 2019, a total of 169 lesions with clinically occult EBC less than 2 cm who underwent preoperative breast\\nMRI including DWI and mammography were retrospectively included in this study. Lesion conspicuity, size, type, detection rate,\\nlevel of suspicion on each modality were evaluated and ADC and CNR on DWI were also obtained. Tumor histopathologic features on\\nsurgical specimen were recorded. Chi-square and Wilcoxon signed-rank test were used to calculate P values.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nOf 169 lesions, there were DCIS in 46 (27%), microinvasive ductal carcinoma in 17 (10%), invasive ductal carcinoma in 97 (57%),\\ninvasive lobular carcinoma in 3 (2%), and other invasive carcinoma in 6 (4%). According to size of invasive cancer, 64 (38%), were\\nmore than 1 cm, 42 (25%) were less than 1 cm, and the remaining 63 (37.3%) were noninvasive cancer. Detection rate of\\nnoninvasive cancer was 49% for mammography, 81% for DWI, 81% for DCE-MRI, whereas that of invasive cancer less than 1 cm\\nwas 57%, 86%, 83%, respectively. That of invasive cancer more than 1 cm was 72% for mammography, 92% for DWI, 97% for\\nDCE-MRI.

This approach is labour intensive and difficult to\\nachieve due to ongoing workforce crisis. This retrospective study explores the role of an AI product to replace the 2nd human\\nreader.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\n3 Breast Screening Centres provided anonymised mammograms from Jan 2012-2019 for this IRB approved study. Each centre\\nemployed double reading with arbitration of discordant opinions by either a single third human reader or group of readers. The\\noriginal human reading opinionsand outcomes at assessment for recalled cases with pathology were obtained from the National\\nBreast Screening information system. The mammograms used in this study were a random sample from the entire data set which\\nhad not been used for algorithm development or training. The AI algorithms opinion (normal or cancer) was paired with the opinion\\nof the 1st human reader to simulate double reading. Sensitivity, specificity and discordant opinion rate were calculated\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\n40,588 mammograms were reviewed. All were read by two human readers with 1,216/40,588 (3%) having a discordant opinion\\nrequiring arbitration. Overall 40,230 had a normal outcome and 358 were biopsy proven cancers. The overall recall rate was 4%,\\nwith a cancer detection rate of 8.5 per 1000. When the AI algorithm was applied as the second reader to this test set, there was\\nconsensus in 33,255 (81.9% ) of the reads to either recall or not recall the cases. This meant that 7,333 (18.1%) of reads were\\ndiscordant between the 1st human reader and the AI algorithm. The AI algorithm had a sensitivity of 85.5% and specificity of\\n87.2% compared with the first human reader with a sensitivity of 89.4% and specificity 96%. Combining the AI algorithm with\\nreader 1 gave a sensitivity 95.0% and specificity of 96.9%, cancer detection rate of 8.4 per 1000 and recall rate of 4%.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nUsing an AI algorithm to replace the 2nd human reader would have allowed 81.9% of the women to obtain a definitive diagnosis of\\nnormal or abnormal. Only 18.1% of cases would need the input of an additional human reader, providing a feasible solution to\\ncombat the workforce crisis within breast imaging.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThis study shows that an AI algorithm is a viable option to replace the second human reader in the double reading of screening\\nmammograms.\\n\\nSSBR04-02 Deep Learning Model Translates Imaging Biomarkers to Predict Future Breast Cancer Risk:\\n\\nSurpassing Traditional Methods of Risk Assessment\\n\\nParticipants\\nLeslie Lamb, MD, Boston, MA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nAdam Yala, Cambridge, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nPeter Mikhael, Cambridge, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nRegina Barzilay, PhD, Cambridge, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nConstance D.

The purpose of this study was to compare the predictive accuracy of the DL image-only\\nmodel to that of Tyrer Cuzick version 8 (TC8), a traditional risk model that incorporates patient history and breast density to\\npredict future breast cancer risk.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThe DL risk assessment model was developed using consecutive bilateral screening mammograms from 80818 patients between 2009\\nto 2016. Mammograms were randomly assigned to training, validation, or testing, resulting in 210819 examinations in 56831\\npatients, 25644 in 7021 patients, and 9290 in 3961 patients, respectively. No patients were excluded for model training and\\nvalidation. For comparison of our 5-year DL model performance to TC8, women with a personal history of breast cancer, those who\\ndeveloped cancer within 3 months of the index screening mammogram, and those who lacked 5-year imaging follow-up were\\nexcluded. Cancer outcomes were obtained through linkage to a regional tumor registry. DL model vs TC8 model performance was\\ncompared using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) with DeLong test (p< 0.05).\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nMean patient age was 56.4 years (range 35 to 91). 6554/9290 (70.5%) were in post-menopausal patients and 2736/9290 (29.5%)\\nwere in pre-menopausal patients. 5170/9290 (55.7%) of patients had non-dense breasts (fatty/scattered fibroglandular) and\\n4116/9290 (44.3%) had dense breasts (heterogeneously dense/extremely dense). 7563/9290 (81.4%) were in white patients,\\n444/9290 (4.8%) in african american and 442/9290 (4.8%) in asian/pacific islander races. Race was unknown in 841/9290 (9.1%).\\nThe AUC of DL model was 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.676, 0.749) compared to 0.61 (95% CI: 0.572, 0.658) by TC8\\nmodel (p<0.001).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nMammograms contain highly predictive biomarkers of future cancer risk, not identified by traditional risk models. A DL model using\\nscreening mammography alone can improve risk discriminatory accuracy compared to traditional modern risk models which rely on\\nclinical history and mammographic breast density.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nTraditional risk models can be time-consuming to acquire and rely on inconsistent or missing data. A DL image-only risk model can\\nprovide increased access to more accurate, less costly risk assessment.\\n\\nSSBR04-03 What Impact Could AI Based Computer Aided Detection Have on the Number and Biological\\n\\nRelevance of Interval Cancers in a Population Based Screening Programme?\\n\\nParticipants\\nSarah J.

The aims of this study were: 1) to assess whether an AI-based computer\\naided detection software (CAD) could identify relevant findings on prior screens 2) to compare CAD with reader categorisation of IC\\nand 3) to ascertain the histologic subtype of CAD-detected ICs.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nNecessity for informed consent was waived in this retrospective study of anonymised images. Consecutive ICs with available\\ndiagnostic and prior screening mammograms (PS) and controls with subsequent normal screens were identified from NHS BSP\\nrecords. Exclusion criteria were: incomplete mammography, IC outside the field of view and unavailable pathology. BI-RADS density,\\nCAD global scores and prompts were recorded. Prompts were deemed true positive (TP) if they corresponded to the site of the\\nsubsequent IC. CAD specificity was set at 96% to match the UK screening recall rate of 4%. CAD scores and prompts on PS were\\ncompared with prior NHS BSP categorization of IC (true interval, occult, minimal signs or false negative). Proportions of TP prompts\\non PS were calculated and correlated with grade and receptor status of ICs. ROC curve analysis and Chi2 tests were used at 95%\\nsignificance level.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\n852 controls and 300 ICs were analyzable. Median CAD scores were: controls, 4.22; PS, 7.53; IC, 9.69. By NHS BSP categorization,\\n149 (50%) were true intervals, 42 (14%) mammographically occult, 49 (16%) minimal signs and 60 (20%) false negative. ROC area\\nunder the curve (AUC) for the entire IC cohort was 0.72 (95% C.I. 0.68-0.75). Of 109 false negative/minimal sign cases, CAD\\ncorrectly identified 21 at a recall rate of 4%. 15 (71%) were grade 1/2 and 20/21 were ER positive. In the true interval group, CAD\\nwould have recalled 14/149 (9%); 9 were grade 3 (p. 0.097). For the occult group diagnosed within 12 months of PS (n=45), the\\nAUC was 0.73 (95% C.I. 0.66-0.81); for BIRADS density alone it was 0.59 (95% C.I. 0.5 - 0.99).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nAI-based CAD localised some cancers on prior screens that were missed by readers, mostly low/intermediate grade ER positive\\ncancers.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nIn a 3-yearly breast screening programme, AI CAD may improve detection of subtle cancers, and might have a role in triage of\\n\\n\\x0ccases considered imperceptible to human readers for enhanced screening.\\n\\nSSBR04-04 Retrospective Evaluation of Three Commercial AI Cad Algorithms for Independent Assessment of\\n\\nScreening Mammograms - Standalone and in Combination With Radiologists\\n\\nParticipants\\nMattie Salim, MD, Stockholm, Sweden (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nErik Wahlin, Stockholm, Sweden (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nKarin Dembrower, MD, Stockholm, Sweden (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nMartin Eklund, Stockholm, Sweden (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nKevin Smith, Stockholm, Sweden (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nFredrik Strand, MD,PhD, Solna, Sweden (Presenter) Consultant, Collective Minds Radiology AB\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nfredrik.strand@ki.se\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo determine whether commercial AI CAD algorithms for screening mammography have reached a performance level on par with\\nradiologists, and to examine the results of combining independent assessments by algorithms and radiologists.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThe study sample was derived from a population-based screening cohort from 2008 to 2015. There were 739 women diagnosed with\\nbreast cancer at screening or within 12 months thereafter, and 8,066 women who remained healthy for at least 2 years. The digital\\nmammograms were processed by three commercial AI algorithms (AI-1, AI-2 and AI-3). The area under the ROC curve was\\ncalculated. For comparisons, the operating points of algorithms were determined by the specificity of first-reader radiologists\\n(96.6%). Diagnostic metrics, including sensitivity, were calculated based on a simulated screening cohort for which each\\nobservation of healthy women were duplicated 14 times. The study was approved by the Ethical Review Board.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe area under the ROC was 0.956 (95%CI: 0.948 to 0.965), 0.922 (95%CI: 0.910 to 0.934) and 0.920 (95%CI: 0.909 to 0.931)\\nfor AI-1, AI-2, and AI-3 respectively. For algorithms at first-reader radiologists\\' specificity level, the sensitivity was 81.9%, 67.0%,\\n67.4%, 77.4% and 80.1% for AI-1, AI-2, AI-3, first-readers and second-readers respectively. The differences between AI-1 and all\\nothers, except second readers, were significant. In a simulated screening cohort of 113,663 exams with independent double-\\nreading, first readers made 4408 abnormal assessments, which increased by 78%, 81%, 78% and 24% when adding AI-1, AI-2, AI-3\\nand second readers respectively. First readers made 572 true positive assessments (among 739 diagnosed women), which\\nincreased by 15%, 8%, 9% and 12% when adding the assessments of AI-1, AI-2, AI-3 and second readers respectively.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nOne commercial CAD algorithm performed better than first-reader radiologists and on par with second-reader radiologists in\\nindependent reading of screening mammograms. When combining algorithms with radiologists, more cancers were detected but\\nabnormal assessments increased disproportionally. In two-reader settings, future studies should focus on reducing the total number\\nof abnormal interpretations when combining one radiologist with one algorithm.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nIt is time for prospective clinical studies of AI CAD as independent second readers, in controlled settings.\\n\\nSSBR04-05 The Potential of AI for Improving Early Detection in Breast Cancer Screening to Reduce Interval\\n\\nCancer Rates\\n\\nParticipants\\nAlexander Wanders, MMedSc, Voorhout, Netherlands (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nAlejandro Rodriguez-Ruiz, Nijmegen, Netherlands (Abstract Co-Author) Employee, ScreenPoint Medical BV\\nWillem J.

The last screening mammograms of all IC cases diagnosed in the region South\\nWest of the Dutch Breast Screening Program between 2011 and 2015 were consecutively collected. During this period, recall,\\ncancer detection, and interval cancer rates varied per year between 2.1-2.5%, 5.9-6.9/1000 and 2.2-2.6/1000, respectively.The\\nhistopathology, pTNM Pathological Classification, and treatment information were retrieved when available. For each IC case, two\\ncontrol cases (normal mammograms verified by at least 2-year follow-up) were collected from the same screening program,\\nmatched by age and year of examination.All mammograms were processed by an AI cancer detection system (Transpara,\\nScreenPoint Medical). Breast density was computed using automated software (LIBRA, Univ. of Pennsylvania). The performance of\\nthe AI system for detection of cancer in IC cases at screening prior to diagnosis was estimated in terms of the area under the\\nreceiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\n\\x0cIn total 2332 IC cases (median 15 months from negative screening until IC diagnosis, interquartile range 9-20 months) and 4664\\ncontrols were included.The AUC of AI to detect IC in screening was 0.73 (95% CI = 0.72-0.74). The sensitivity was 37.1% and\\n18.5% at specificity of 90% and 97.5%, respectively. In comparison, the AUC of breast density was 0.70 (95% CI = 0.68-0.73),\\nwith sensitivity of 23.3% and 6.5% at specificity of 90% and 97.5%.No difference in AI AUC was found when stratifying by\\nDCIS/invasive IC. A small trend towards higher AI AUC was found for IC diagnosed after an incident round (0.74 vs 0.70 after a\\nprevalent round), as well as for IC treated with breast amputation (0.75 vs 0.72 for IC that received breast-conserving\\ntreatments).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nAI has the potential to reduce interval cancer rates, whether by being used as an independent reader or as a pre-selection tool to\\ndetermine which cases could benefit from additional screening imaging.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThere is still a stable rate of interval cancers (often with worse prognosis than screening-detected cancers) in screening programs.\\nNew AI-based strategies could help to reduce interval cancer rates.\\n\\nSSBR04-06 The Effect of Breast Density on a Neural Network Classifier in Breast Cancer Screening\\n\\nParticipants\\nEric Kim, MD, New York, NY (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nUjas N.

The GMIC is a neural network model that aggregates both global and\\nlocal information to make predictions of malignancy for each breast of a screening mammogram. The breast density was determined\\nby the original interpreting radiologist using the BI-RADS classification for breast density. The reference standard for determining\\nthe presence of malignancy was the pathology reports. Once the model was trained, a non-enriched reader study was performed to\\ncompare the performance of the model to 14 radiologists. Each reader independently provided probability estimates of malignancy\\nfor each breast in 720 screening exams (1,440 breasts). Among the 1,440 breasts, 61 breasts were associated with biopsy-proven\\nmalignant findings, 30 in non-dense breasts and 31 in dense breasts. Performance of the model and the radiologists was assessed\\nusing area under the ROC curve (AUC) analysis. The ability of the model and the radiologists to detect biopsy-proven malignancy\\nwas compared using the Fisher\\'s Exact Test.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe model achieved an overall AUC of 0.925, performing better in non-dense breasts than dense breasts (AUC 0.941 vs AUC\\n0.908). In the reader study, the model achieved an AUC of 0.897 (non-dense: 0.908, dense: 0.885) while the average of\\nradiologists achieved an AUC of 0.895 (non-dense: 0.935, dense: 0.856). Both the model and average of radiologists correctly\\nidentified 28/30 (93.3%) malignancies in non-dense breasts. The model identified 29/31 (93.5%) and the average of radiologists\\nidentified 26/31 (83.9%) malignancies in dense breasts (p=0.42).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe performance of our model is superior in non-dense breasts versus dense breasts for predicting malignancy on screening\\nmammogram, and is similar to that of radiologists.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThe classifier predicts malignancy on screening mammogram at the level of radiologists in both non-dense and dense breasts.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSBR07\\n\\nScience Session with Keynote: Breast Imaging (Artificial Intelligence)\\n\\nFriday, Dec. 4 2:00PM - 3:00PM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nGU MR OI\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .75\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSBR07-01 Breast Imaging Keynote Speaker: Assessing the Value of AI in Breast Imaging\\n\\nParticipants\\nFiona J.

In this study we applied deep learning to\\npredict subtypes based on ER, PR and HER2. A conventional convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent CNN using\\nconvolutional long short term memory (CLSTM) were used to compare their performance.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nA total of 244 patients were analyzed, 99 in training dataset scanned on a Siemens 1.5T system. The independent testing dataset\\nwas collected from a different hospital with a total of 145 patients, scanned on a GE 3T system. Patients were classified into 3\\nsubtypes based on hormonal receptor (HR) and HER2 receptor: (HR+/HER2-), HER2+ and triple negative (TN). Only DCE images were\\nused. The smallest bounding box covering tumor ROI was used as the input for deep learning to develop the first model in the\\nTraining dataset. Then, transfer learning was applied to re-tune the model for the testing dataset, by splitting it based on the time\\nof MRI into 83 patients in Testing-1 and 62 patients in Testing-2.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nIn the training dataset, the mean accuracy was higher by using CLSTM (0.91) than CNN (0.79). When the developed model was\\napplied to the independent testing datasets, the accuracy was only 0.4-0.5, suggesting that the developed model cannot be\\ndirectly applied. With transfer learning by re-tuning parameters using one part of the testing dataset (Testing-1), the mean\\naccuracy reached 0.91 by CNN and 0.83 by CLSTM. The re-trained model improved accuracy in the other part of the testing\\ndataset (Testing-2) from 0.47 to 0.78 by CNN, and from 0.39 to 0.74 by CLSTM. Overall, transfer learning could improve the\\nclassification accuracy by greater than 30%. When the re-tuning was performed using Testing-2 and evaluated in Testing-1, the\\nresults were similar, supporting the robustness of the transfer learning approach.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe recurrent network using CLSTM could track changes in signal intensity during DCE acquisition, and achieved a higher accuracy\\ncompared to conventional CNN. For datasets acquired using different settings, transfer learning can be applied to generate\\ndataset-specific model.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThis study elaborates how the developed AI methods using a training dataset can be implemented in a different clinical setting by\\ntransfer learning, to predict different molecular subtype of breast cancer.\\n\\n\\x0cSSBR07-04 Development and Validation of an Artificial Intelligence Algorithm for Breast Density Assessment in\\n\\n2D and Synthetic 2D Mammography\\n\\nParticipants\\nJaehwan Lee, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Presenter) Employee, Lunit Inc\\nKi Hwan Kim, MD,PhD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Employee, Lunit Inc\\nHyunsuk Yoo, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Employee, Lunit Inc\\nHyo-Eun Kim, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Employee, Lunit Inc\\nHak Hee Kim, MD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nEun-Kyung Kim, MD, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nBoo-Kyung Han, MD, PhD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithm for assessing breast density using 2D mammography and validate it on 2D and\\nsynthetic 2D mammography images.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nA total of 283,122 2D mammograms and original reports collected from multiple hospitals were used to develop an AI algorithm for\\nassessing mammographic breast density. The AI algorithm was validated us-ing 800 2D mammography exams collected from two\\ncountries, all with corresponding original radiologic reports. Three breast radiologists individually re-evaluated the breast density\\nand a majority vote was used to determine the ground truth (GT). The agreement between AI and GT was compared with that be-\\ntween the original reports and GT using linear-weighted Cohen\\'s kappa value. The performance for binary categorization of dense\\n(density= c,d) and nondense (density=a,b) tissue was also quantified with McNemar\\'s test. Finally, to demonstrate that AI can be\\napplied to synthetic 2D images, a separate dataset was collected from a total of 300 patients who underwent both traditional 2D\\nand synthetic 2D images in combo mode, and the agreement between AI and GT was calculated.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nAgreement between AI and GT (kappa=0.84, 95% CI: 0.82-0.86) was higher than that between radiologic report sand GT\\n(kappa=0.77, 95% CI: 0.74-0.80). For binary categorization, the proportion of dense breast density that matched GT was\\nsignificantly higher for AI (97%[400/413]) vs. radiologic reports (92%[378/413], p<0.001), while the proportion of non-dense breast\\nthat matched GT was not significantly different for AI (93%[361/387]) vs. radiologic reports (94%[364/387, p=0.58]). Finally, for\\nsynthetic 2D images, there was good agreement between AI and GT (kappa=0.74, 95% CI: 0.69-0.79) and between re-port and GT\\n(kappa=0.73, 95% CI: 0.67-0.78), with strong linear correlation between AI score obtained for 2D and synthetic 2D images (r2 =\\n0.906, p<0.001).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe AI algorithm, developed using large-scale mammography data, assessed mammographic breast density at the level of\\nradiologists for both 2D and synthetic 2D mammograms.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nAn AI algorithm can reliably be applied to assess mammographic breast density in clinical practice.\\n\\nSSBR07-05 Using AI to Triage Which Screening Mammograms Benefit from a Double Reading Strategy\\n\\nParticipants\\nChristiana Balta, PhD, Nijmegen, Netherlands (Abstract Co-Author) Employee, ScreenPoint Medical BV\\nAlejandro Rodriguez-Ruiz, Nijmegen, Netherlands (Presenter) Employee, ScreenPoint Medical BV\\nChristophs Mieskes, Munich, Germany (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nNico Karssemeijer, PhD, Nijmegen, Netherlands (Abstract Co-Author) Director, ScreenPoint Medical BVShareholder, ScreenPoint\\nMedical BVShareholder, Volpara Health Technologies LimitedConsultant, QView Medical, IncShareholder, QView Medical, Inc\\nSylvia H.

An AI system (Transpara version 1.6.0, ScreenPoint Medical) automatically analyzed\\neach mammogram and assigned an \\'AI-Score\\' 1-10. The higher the AI-Score the higher the likelihood of malignancy within the DM\\nexam. The AI-Score is calibrated such that in a screening population approximately 10% of mammograms are assigned to each\\ncategory. The hypothesis was that in DM exams with an AI-Score lower or equal than a threshold, single-reading would have been\\nsufficient, while those exams with higher AI-Score, double-reading would be beneficial. All AI-Scores (1-9) were investigated as\\npotential thresholds. Cancer detection rate (CDR), recall rate and positive predictive value (PPV) of the simulated triaging screening\\nstrategy were compared to the original outcomes, using a McNemar\\'s test to analyze paired data.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe original double reading resulted in a CDR of 6.4/1000, recall rate of 5.4% and PPV of 11.9%. By selecting an AI-Score threshold\\nof 7 to triage double reading, the number of exams (n=6229) to be double read could be reduced by 65% without having an impact\\non sensitivity. CDR would have remained unchanged (6.4/1000), recall rate would have been reduced by 11.8% (down to 4.8%,\\nP<0.001) and PPV would have been increased by 10.5% (up to 13.3%, P<0.001), compared to double reading of all mammograms.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nAI can be used to triage screening mammograms that would benefit most from double reading, reducing workload and improving\\nscreening performance.\\n\\n\\x0cCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nAI-based triaging of screening mammograms for single or double reading can potentially improve the quality of screening and lead to\\nmore effective use of radiologists\\' reading time on mammograms.\\n\\nSSBR07-06 Deep Learning to Reduce Unnecessary Biopsy in Breast Cancer Screening\\n\\nParticipants\\nChang Liu, Pittsburgh, PA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nMin Sun, MD,PhD, Pittsburgh, PA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nDooman Arefan, PhD, Pittsburgh, PA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nMargarita L.

We employed\\nconvolutional neural network model VGG-16 to perform 4 binary classification tasks: (I) benign vs. all atypia+invasive+DCIS, aiming\\nto identity the benign cases whose biopsy can be avoided; (II) benign+pure atypia vs. atypia-upstaged+invasive+DCIS, aiming to\\nconservatively reduce biopsy for patients who are not candidates for chemoprevention of atypia; (III) benign vs. each of the other\\n3 classes individually, aiming for a precise diagnosis; and (IV) pure atypia vs. atypia-upstaged, aiming to reduce unnecessary\\nexcisional biopsy on atypia patients. 10-fold cross-validation was performed and AUC and sensitivity were reported.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nA 95% sensitivity in the \\'higher stage disease\\' class was ensured for all tasks. The sensitivity of benign was 29% in task I and 25%\\nin task II, respectively. In task III, the respective sensitivity of benign was 30% (vs atypia), 46% (vs DCIS), and 41% (vs invasive\\ntumor). In task IV, the sensitivity of pure atypia was 35%. The AUC values for the 4 tasks were 0.64, 0.67, 0.70/0.72/0.76, and\\n0.67, respectively.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nDeep learning of digital mammograms from BI-RADS 4 patients can identify 25%-35% patients who may potentially avoid\\nunnecessary biopsies while ensuring 95% sensitivity of the \"higher stage disease\" (atypia, DCIS, and invasive breast cancer).\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nApplying AI models to stratify BI-RADS 4 patients may better inform clinical decisions to reduce unnecessary biopsies, thus alleviate\\nclinical procedures, financial cost, and patients\\' anxiety/stress.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSBR08\\n\\nBreast Imaging (MRI)\\n\\nW ednesday, Dec. 2 3:30PM - 4:30PM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nCT MK MR AI\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .50\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSBR08-01 The Fat-Tumor Interface on Magnetic Resonance Imaging: Novel Imaging Biomarker in Breast\\n\\nCancer Patients Treated with Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy\\n\\nParticipants\\nEun Sook Ko, MD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nKyoung Lan Ko, MD, Goyang, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nBoo-Kyung Han, MD, PhD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nEun Young Ko, MD, PhD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJi Soo Choi, MD, PhD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nKo Woon Park, MD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo evaluate the clinical significance of the fat-tumor interface based on pretreatment MRI to predict the pathologic complete\\nresponse (pCR) in patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and to validate the effect of this new quantitative\\nimaging biomarker on pCR using external cohort.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nA total of 1140 patients who were treated with NAC were retrospectively enrolled from two hospitals (development cohort [n =\\n1004] and external validation cohort [n = 136]). Using pretreatment MRI, the fat-tumor interface was quantitatively calculated\\nbased on k-means clustering algorithm and the cutoff point of the fat-tumor interface to divide the patients into interface-rich and\\ninterface-poor groups was determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Univariable and multivariable logistic\\nregression analyses and subgroup analysis were performed to determine the association of the fat-tumor interface and\\nclinicopathological variables with pCR.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nPatients classified into interface-rich group were less likely to have a pCR (P < 0.001). Higher fat-tumor interface were significantly\\nassociated with worse pathologic outcome in both the development and validation sets (P = 0.030 and 0.002, respectively). In\\nsubgroup analyses, higher fat-tumor interface was significant prognostic factor in obese (P < 0.001), higher Ki-67 level (P = 0.041),\\nHR-/HER2+ cancer (P = 0.038), and the biggest tertile for tumor volume group (P = 0.045).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nHigher fat-tumor interface is significant prognostic factor in patients treated with NAC.

Heterogeneous tumors are less likely to have durable therapeutic responses, and\\n\\n\\x0cheterogeneous perfusion is a primary driver of intratumoral heterogeneity. Using dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) breast MRI,\\ntumor voxels with similar DCE characteristics may be segmented into sub-regions (habitats) to quantify heterogeneity. In this\\nstudy, we investigated whether intratumoral heterogeneity quantified on DCE-MRI was predictive of pCR.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nIn this retrospective study, 61 women were divided into training (43) and validation (18) cohorts after matching for age and tumor\\nhormone receptor status. Tumor were segmented by two radiologists on the pre-NAC DCE-MRI. Voxel multi-parametric maps were\\ncomputed from four perfusion parameters: wash-in and washout slopes, percentage enhancement, and signal enhancement ratio.\\nUsing consensus clustering, superpixel maps divided each tumor into low, moderate, and high perfusion habitats. The process was\\nrepeated across the training set. A fourth habitat included the breast parenchyma bordering the tumor. For each patient, a 4x4\\nmultiregional spatial interaction matrix generated 22 features. Feature similarities between patients within the training cohort were\\nexplored with a network-based strategy, and a spectral clustering algorithm was used to divide patients by pCR status. A\\nmultinomial model was built to cluster multiparametric maps into tumor habitats. The ability of the model to predict pCR was tested\\nin the validation cohort.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nPatient age (years) was similar in the training (51±10) and validation (50±10) cohorts. Tumor characteristics were similar between\\nthe training and validation cohorts, with ER positivity in 58% and 56%, PR positivity in 53% and 56%, and Her2 positivity in 33%\\nand 28%, respectively. In each group, 28% achieved pCR. The model predicted pCR with 95% accuracy in training and 83% in the\\nvalidation cohort.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIntratumoral perfusion heterogeneity on dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI is predictive of pCR.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nAn extension of radiomics, called habitat imaging, can predict pCR on pre-neoadjuvant chemotherapy breast MRI in women\\ndiagnosed with breast cancer.\\n\\nSSBR08-04 Inversion of Transport Equation for Automatic Postprocessing of Dynamic Contrast Enhanced MRI\\n\\nWithout Arterial Input Function: Application in Breast Tumors\\n\\nParticipants\\nQihao Zhang, BS, New York, NY (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nPascal Spincemaille, PhD, New York, NY (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nMichele B.

Region\\nof interest (ROI) analysis on tumors was performed to assess QTM velocity, QTM diffusion and Kety\\'s flow for distinguishing benign\\nand malignant tumors. Mann-Whitney U test and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were performed to assess\\nthe diagnostic performance.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nBetween malignant and benign tumors, there was a significant difference in QTM velocity (0.12±0.05 mm/s vs 0.06±0.04 mm/s,\\np=0.006), but not in QTM diffusion coefficient (0.023±0.017 mm2/s vs 0.014±0.009 mm2/s, p=0.150) or Kety\\'s flow\\n(51.25±25.83mL/100g/min vs 32.37±22.18 mL/100g/min, p=0.13).

All of the patients underwent DM, DBT\\nand US as a first step and preoperative MRI after the confirmation of malignancy. Second look US was routinely performed to study\\nadditional lesions detected by MRI. For this study we reviewed the cancers detected by the conventional modalities (DM, DBT and\\nUS) (Group A) and the additional cancers only detected by MRI (group B). The studied features were: Pathology (morphological and\\nimmunohistochemical patterns), size and rate of mastectomies. Chi-square and t-Student tests were used.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThere were 444 cancers in group A (70 DCIS, 326 IDC, 48 ILC) and 48 additional cancers in group B (13 DCIS, 30 IDC, 5 ILC).\\nAccording to the immunohistochemical patterns of invasive cancers, the distribution in group A was: 194 Luminal A; 120 Luminal B;\\n14 Pure Her 2; 46 Triple negative; In group B: 14 Luminal A, 13 luminal B, 1 pure Her 2 and 7 Triple negative. The comparison\\nbetween both groups regarding pathology and immunohistochemical patterns showed no significant statistical differences (p=0.5).\\nRegarding the size of the cancers, the mean size of Group A was 14.88 mm while in group B was 11.69mm (p=0.135). In group A\\nthe rate of mastectomies was 17.8% and in group B 33.3% (p=0.118).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nAccording to our results, the MRI-only detected cancers were not different than the remaining cancers detected by conventional\\ntechniques, regarding pathology, immunohistochemical patterns and size, and did not significantly increase the mastectomy rate.\\nThus, MRI-only cancers should not be considered as overdiagnosis or clinically irrelevant.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThe use of preoperative MRI remains still controversial. Some authors argue that MRI-only detected cancers are not of clinical\\nrelevance regarding the prognosis and unnecessarily contribute to increase the rate of mastectomies.\\n\\nSSBR08-06 Breast Cancer in Young Women: Correlation of MR Imaging Features With Recurrence-Free Survival\\n\\nParticipants\\nMi Ran Jung, MD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nEun Young Chae, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJoo Hee Cha, MD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nHee Jung Shin, MD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nWoo Jung Choi, MD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nHak Hee Kim, MD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nmrj12@hanmail.net\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo investigate preoperative breast magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and clinicopathological features associated with recurrence in\\npatients with young age breast cancer.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThis retrospective study analyzed 259 patients with breast cancer under the age of 35 between January 2011 and December 2014.\\nAll patients underwent breast MR imaging, followed by surgery. Breast MR images prior to surgery were independently reviewed by\\ndedicated breast radiologists who were blinded to patient outcomes. The clinicopathological data including patient demographics,\\nclinical features, and tumor characteristics were also reviewed. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used for\\nunivariate and multivariate analyses to identify independent predictors of recurrence-free survival (RFS).\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nOf the 259 patients, 44 patients (17.0%) developed recurrences after a median follow-up of 69 months (range, 2-106 months). At\\nunivariate analysis, progesterone receptor negativity, type of surgery, adjuvant radiation therapy, T3 tumor size at MR, multifocal\\nor multicentric disease, intratumoral high signal intensity and peritumoral edema on T2-weighted image (T2WI) were associated with\\nRFS. According to multivariate analysis, T3 tumor size at MR (hazard ratio, 2.416) and the presence of peritumoral edema on T2WI\\n(hazard ratio, 2.749) remained significant independent predictors associated with worse RFS.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe tumor size over 5 cm and the presence of peritumoral edema at preoperative breast MR were independent variables that\\npredict recurrences in young age breast cancer patients.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nBreast cancer in young women are known to have worse survival outcomes than older patients.

In patients with\\nan indication for invasive coronary angiography (ICA) additional optical coherence tomography (OCT) was conducted. The findings\\nof CCTA und OCT were carefully matched and compared.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nIn 68 patients 50 non-calcified plaques were detected by SCCTA. Mean density was 70 ± 56 HU. Mean Iodine uptake was 2.4 ±\\n2.1mg/ml, respectively. There was significant correlation between iodine uptake and density of coronary plaques; r = 0.67, p <\\n0.001. Eighteen patients had an indication for ICA and underwent additional OCT. Thirty-five plaques could by matched by both\\nmodalities. All plaques detected by SCCTA had a correlate on OCT while only 86% of the plaques detected by OCT could be\\ndetected in SCCTA. OCT detected 31 (67%) high risk plaques: Six Thin cab fibroatheromas (13%), 25 fibroatheromas (54%).\\nFurther 15 (33%) low risk plaques were detected by OCT: Three fibrocalcific lesions (7%), eleven cases of pathological intima\\nthickening (24%) and one Early-onset fibroatheroma (2%). Mean iodine uptake in SCCTA was lower in high risk plaques (2.5mg/ml\\nvs. 3.3mg/ml, p = 0.06). Minimal iodine uptake in SCCTA was significantly lower in high risk plaques (1.0mg/ml vs. 2.0mg/ml, p =\\n0.019). ROC analysis with high risk plaque defined by OCT as reference showed an AUC for minimal iodine uptake of 71%. All plaques\\nshowed similar HU\\'s and could not be distinguished by conventional technique.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIodine uptake in plaques measured by SCCTA is feasible and seems to provide additional information about plaques beyond\\nconventional CT plaque characterization based on plaque density.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nSCCTA seems to be able to distinguish high risk plaques from plaques with lower risk by measuring iodine uptake. Spectral-CT might\\nprovide additional prognostic value which should be confirmed in larger outcome studies.\\n\\nSSCA01-02 Qualitative Evaluation of Coronary Plaques and Stents With Energy Integrating and Photon-Counting\\n\\nComputed Tomography: A Phantom Study\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Medical Student\\n\\nParticipants\\nFaraz Farhadi, Bethesda, MD (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nJayasai R.

Stented (n=8) and non-\\nstented (n=10) plaques covering different types of plaque composition were selected for the study. Images were acquired at\\nmatched parameters (120 kV, 118 mAs) for PCCT and EID CT systems with 5 repetitions and reconstructed with a routine clinical\\nprotocol. PCCT images were also reconstructed with a specialized high-resolution kernel (PCCT-HR). Rectangular regions of interest\\nwere placed at the central slice of the plaques and extracted from all three image groups, to create three-alternative forced rank\\ntasks of stented (n=40) and non-stented (n=50) plaque images. Three physicians with expertise in coronary CT interpretation were\\nasked to rank non-stented image groups based on plaque conspicuity and stented images for those least affected by blooming.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nFor both tasks, all three observers ranked the high-resolution PCCT images first in every case. In non-stented plaques, two readers\\nfavored standard PCCT over EID CT images with PCCT ranked second in 62% and 92% of cases, while the third reader ranked PCCT\\nsecond in 50% of cases. For the stented plaques, two readers favored EID CT over standard PCCT with EID ranking second in 58%\\nand 78% of cases, while the third reader ranked standard PCCT second in 63% of cases.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nHigh-resolution PCCT images had superior plaque conspicuity and were less affected by blooming effect in the stented images than\\neither EID CT or standard PCCT data. Standard PCCT images offered better plaque conspicuity but performed worse in the presence\\nof stents when compared to clinical EID images.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nHigh-resolution photon-counting CT images can improve visualization of coronary plaques and reduce the impact of metallic stent\\nblooming when compared to the EID CT.\\n\\nSSCA01-03 Calcium Scoring using Virtual Non-Contrast Images from a Dual-layer Spectral CT: Comparison to\\n\\nReal Non-Contrast Data and Evaluation of Proportionality Factor in a Large Patient Collective\\n\\nParticipants\\nFelix Gassert, MD, Munich, Germany (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nChristina Mueller-Leisse, Munich, Germany (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nClaudio E.

In an initial approach our own group demonstrated reliable determination of CACS from contrast enhanced\\nCoronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA). However, the previous data was non-clinical and the sample size was small.\\nOur objective was to evaluate the accuracy of CACS from virtual non-contrast imaging computed from spectral data in comparison\\nto standard non-contrast imaging in a large patient collective with clinically approved software.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nWe investigated 103 patients referred to CCTA with suspicion of CAD on a Philips IQon Spectral CT scanner. Virtual non-contrast\\nimages were generated in Philips Intellispace Portal. CACS was calculated from both, real- and virtual non-contrast images by\\ncertified software for medical use. Patients with a CACS of 0 were excluded from analysis.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nMean age was 61±11 years. 48 patients (67%) were male. Inter-quartile-range of clinical CACS was 22-282. Correlation of\\nmeasured CACS from real- and virtual non-contrast images was very high (0.95); p < 0.001. The slope was 3,83 indicating an\\nunderestimation of virtual non-contrast CACS compared to real CACS by that factor. Visual analysis of Bland-Altman-Plot:of CACS\\nshowed good accordance of both methods after correction of virtual non-contrast CACS by the above mentioned factor.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIn clinical diagnostic of CAD, determination of CACS is feasible using virtual non-contrast images generated from spectral imaging\\nwith a dual layer detector. When multiplied by a correction factor results show good agreement with the standard technique.\\n\\n\\x0cCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nIn future clinical diagnostics of CAD, CACS can be calculated from virtual non-contrast images using dual layer spectral imaging.\\nTherefore, radiation exposure will be reduced through omitting native scans.\\n\\nSSCA01-04 Pericoronary Fat Attenuation Index Using Dual-layer Spectral Detector CT - A Sensitive Imaging\\n\\nMarker of High-risk Plaques\\n\\nParticipants\\nXujiao Chen, Shenyang, China (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nYuxue Dang, Shenyang, China, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nQuanmei Ma, Shenyang, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nYue Ma, Shenyang, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nXiao Mei Lu, MMed, Shenyang, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nYang Hou, MD, Shenyang, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\n1464753732@qq.com\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nThis study sought to assess the association between pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) attenuation derived from spectral CT and\\natherosclerotic plaque and explore the imaging marker to improve high-risk plaque identification in patients with coronary\\natherosclerosis.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nWe prospectively analyzed 402 plaques including high-risk plaques in 151 consecutive patients who underwent coronary CT\\nangiography based on dual-layer spectral detector spectral CT (SDCT). The plaque anatomical characteristics and PCAT\\nattenuation around the lesion were measured. PCAT attenuation indicators including FAI derived from conventional CT images\\n(FAIcon), virtual mono-energetic images at 40 keV (FAI40keV), the slope of spectral HU curve (λHU) and effective atomic number\\n(Zeff). This study aimed to explore: (i) the relationship between PCAT attenuation changes and atherosclerotic plaque progression;\\n(ii) the ability of FAI derived from SDCT to detect high-risk plaques.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nIn Part 1, PCAT attenuation increased gradually as the increment of high-attenuation percentage in plaque, and FAI indicators\\nderived from SDCT could better detect that change especially FAI40keV but FAIcon can not. Additionally, FAI40keV was more\\npositively correlated with high-attenuation percentage in plaques (r=0.513, P<0.05). In Part 2, PCAT attenuation indicators around\\nhigh-risk plaques was higher than those around stable plaques especially FAI40keV. FAI40keV was a predictive factor of high-risk\\nplaques and higher FAI40keV (>= -120.60 HU) could help identify high-risk plaques with an accuracy of 90.00%.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nAs the atherosclerotic plaque continues to advance, PCAT attenuation increases gradually. FAI40keV derived from SDCT may be a\\nnovel surrogate imaging marker helpful for detecting the PCAT attenuation change as well as identifying high-risk plaques and may\\nbe a valuable tool to guide future prevention strategies\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nSDCT-based coronary CTA can provide not only routine coronary CTA images but also VMI.

CFD-based FFR determination, however, considers the lumen only. Characterizing the\\ntissue within the walls may have advantages over lumen-based simulations, as it is a direct rather than indirect measure of the\\nvasodilative capacity of the vessel. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of non-invasive FFR estimation using\\n\\n\\x0chistologically-validated assessment of plaque morphology on CCTA.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThe study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board and a waiver of informed consent was granted. Patients\\n(n=113) with suspected coronary artery disease who had undergone clinically indicated CCTA and invasive FFR were retrospectively\\nincluded. Commercially available plaque quantification software was used to extract quantitative plaque morphology. Vessel\\nstructure measurements included the degree of stenosis, wall thickness, and remodeling index. An optimized artificial neural network\\nwas used to assess he prognostic value of morphological measurements and stenosis relative to physical FFR as ground truth.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nA total of 122 lesions were considered, 59 (48%) had low FFR values. Plaque morphology-based FFR assessment achieved an area\\nunder the curve, sensitivity and specificity of 0.94, 0.90 and 0.81, respectively, versus 0.71, 0.71, and 0.50, respectively, for an\\noptimized threshold applied to measurement of stenosis by diameter. The optimized ridge regression model for continuous value\\nestimation of FFR was able to achieve a cross-correlation coefficient of 0.56 and regression slope of 0.56 using cross validation in\\nthe training set, versus 0.18 and 0.10 for an optimized threshold applied to measurement of stenosis by diameter.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nOur results show that morphology-based FFR assessment substantially improves the diagnosis of lesion specific ischemia over CCTA\\nstenosis interpretation and has a comparable or superior level of sensitivity and specificity relative to CFD-based approaches.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nIn this study, we showed that CCTA plaque morphology-based FFR measurements derived by an artificial neural network have\\nsuperior diagnostic accuracy compared to stenosis-based CCTA assessment and CFD-based FFR evaluation.\\n\\nSSCA01-06 Contrast to Noise Ratio Between Energy Integrating and Photon Counting Detector on a Phantom\\n\\nUsed for Coronary Artery Calcium Score\\n\\nParticipants\\nPierre-Antoine Rodesch, Lyon, France (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nNiels R.

Both scanners are fitted with the\\nsame X-ray source (filtration and focal spot) and source-to-detector distance. They differ by the detector type and the collimation\\nx pixel pitch at iso-center: 32x0.65mm for the IQon and 64x0.270mm for the SPCCT. Axial scans were performed with a 120kVp\\nsource and several exposures: 10, 20, 30, 40, 60mAs. Images were reconstructed with filtered-back projection, iterative\\nreconstruction level 0 and the same kernel, matrix (512), voxel size (0.43x0.43x1mm). Calcifications were detected with 130\\nHounsfield Unit (HU) threshold. A 2cm2 area was used for HU and noise background levels. CNR was measured in large (5mm) and\\nmedium (3mm) calcifications for three densities: 200, 400 and 800 HA mg/ml. Simple simulated data were used to estimate the\\nexpected HU difference between EIDs and PCDs: a spectrum modeling the source was weighted by the detector sensitivity D to\\nobtain (virtual) measured spectra. For EIDs, D was set to a linear energy weighting: D(E)=E and for PCDs to a constant one:\\nD(E)=1. HU was then computed from the NIST database as the average attenuation weighted by measured spectrum.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nSimulation (cf Table) anticipates greater HU difference as HA density increases. Higher noise levels were measured with the EIDs\\n(difference: 5HU at 60mAs and 10HU at 10mAs). Partial volume effect lowers the mean HU. Despite this effect, the HU values are\\nhigher with the PCDs. Combined with lower noise, it led to significant improvement in CNR. These results imply the HU threshold\\nused for calcification detection has a different impact on each system. A HA density threshold (set by reference to the QRM CCI\\ncalibration inserts) could solve this issue.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe PCD system provides higher CNR for calcification detection in the QRM cardio CT phantom.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nPCD is an emerging technique with improved spatial resolution and contrast to noise ratio, which may improve coronary artery\\ncalcium quantification, especially detection of small calcifications.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSCA05\\n\\nCardiac (Cardiac Imaging and Outcomes)\\n\\nThursday, Dec. 3 3:30PM - 4:30PM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nCA\\n\\nCT MR BQ\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .75\\n\\nFDA  Discussions may include off-label uses.\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSCA05-02 Cardiovascular Risk in the Lung Cancer Screening Population: A Multicenter Study Evaluating the\\n\\nEffects of Coronary Artery Calcification on Statin Delivery\\n\\nParticipants\\nTina D.

Statin eligibility in individuals without preexisting ASCVD was\\ndetermined by the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines: (1) LDL >/=190 mg/dl, (2) diabetes, or (3) ASCVD 10-year risk score >/=7.5%\\n(determined by the pooled cohort equation (PCE), a validated clinical risk calculator). The presence and severity (mild, moderate,\\nheavy) of CAC was abstracted from LCS reports. The effect of reported CAC on statin initiation within 90 days of the LCS was\\nestimated via multivariable regression adjusted for patient sociodemographic/clinical characteristics.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nA total of 5,495 individuals received LCS during the study span. Of 3,771 individuals without known ASCVD, the majority were\\nstatin-eligible (73.6%, 2,777/3,771). However, most statin-eligible individuals were not prescribed a statin (60.5%, 1096/2777).\\nLCS-reported CAC was significantly associated with downstream statin initiation (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.60; 95% confidence\\ninterval (95%CI): 1.12-6.02). Amongst those with CAC, there was a higher likelihood of statin initiation with increasing CAC severity\\n(aOR 2.21; 95%CI: 1.35-3.60)).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe majority of the LCS population is at high ASCVD risk and eligible for guideline-directed statin therapy. Reporting CAC and\\nseverity at LCS exam increases statin prescribing in eligible individuals.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThe 2019 ACC/AHA guidelines include CAC as a risk-enhancing factor for ASCVD preventative care decisions. CAC at LCS may\\nprompt preventative therapy for ASCVD, the leading cause of death in LCS patients.\\n\\nSSCA05-03 Epicardial Fat CT Attenuation in the HIV Population and Its Association to Coronary Atherosclerosis -\\n\\nResults from the BLIND HIV and Aging Cohort Study\\n\\nParticipants\\nManel Sadouni, MD, Montreal, QC (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nMhd Ghaiss Alkeddeh, Montreal, QC (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nCecile Tremblay, MD, Montreal, QC (Abstract Co-Author) Advisory Board, Merck & Co, Inc; Research Grant, Merck & Co, Inc;\\nSpeaker, Merck & Co, Inc; Advisory Board, Gilead Sciences, Inc; Research Grant, Gilead Sciences, Inc; Speaker, Gilead Sciences,\\nInc; Advisory Board, GlaxoSmithKline plc; Research Grant, GlaxoSmithKline plc; Speaker, GlaxoSmithKline plc; ; \\nMadeleine Durand, MD,MSc, Montreal, QC (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\n\\x0cCarl Chartrand-Lefebvre, MD, Montreal, QC (Abstract Co-Author) Research collaboration, TeraRecon, IncResearch collaboration,\\nSiemens AGResearch collaboration, Imagia Cybernetics Inc\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nHIV patients have a higher risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) compared to non-infected patients. Chronic inflammation\\nsecondary to the infection and/or the antiretroviral therapy and mediated by adipose tissue may play a role in this increased risk. In\\nthis study, we measured the computed tomography (CT) attenuation of epicardial fat, a potential surrogate of the inflammatory\\nactivity of fat, in HIV+ and HIV- individuals and assessed its association with coronary plaque burden.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThis is a cross sectional study, nested in the BLIND HIV and Aging Cohort Study, a large prospective cohort following more than\\n1000 HIV+ and HIV- patients. Consecutive participants with low to intermediate cardiovascular risk were invited to undergo cardiac\\nCT. Assessment of volume and CT attenuation of epicardial fat, as well as volume of total atherosclerotic plaque were performed.\\nComparison of epicardial fat attenuation indexed to epicardial fat volume (EFAi) between HIV+ and HIV- participants was performed\\nusing t-test. Association between EFAi and coronary plaque volume was assessed using zero-inflated Poisson regression.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nA total of 265 participants underwent cardiac CT scans. 181 were HIV+ and 84 were HIV-. HIV+ participants had a higher EFAi than\\nHIV- participants (HIV+: -0.62 HU/cm3 [-0.76, -0.49], HIV-: -0.69 HU/cm3 [-0.90, -0.54], p = 0.007). Using multivariate analysis,\\nEFAi was associated to HDL-cholesterol (ß=-0.2, p<0.05), BMI (ß =-0.15, p= 0.013) and to duration of antiretroviral therapy\\n(ß=0.01, p=0.02). After adjustment for significant cardiovascular risk factors, EFAi was significantly associated with total coronary\\nplaque volume (OR=0.26, p=0.04).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIndexed CT attenuation of epicardial fat is significantly higher for HIV+ individuals. The association of epicardial fat CT attenuation\\nwith antiretroviral therapy duration and subclinical coronary artery plaque may suggest a potential mechanism that could explain\\nthe increased risk for CAD in the HIV population.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nIndexed epicardial fat CT attenuation is increased in HIV+ patients and correlates with duration of antiretroviral therapy and total\\ncoronary plaque volume.\\n\\nSSCA05-04 Characteristics of Coronary Artery Disease in Patients with Subclinical Hypothyroidism: Evaluation\\n\\nwith Coronary CT Angiography (CTA)\\n\\nParticipants\\nXinzhu Zhou, Chengdu, China (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nRui Shi, Chengdu, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nKe Shi, Chengdu, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nZhigang Yang, MD, Chengdu, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nSubclinical hypothyroidism(SCH) has recently been acknowledged as an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease\\n(CAD).However, there are few studies about the characteristics of CAD in SCH patients. The aim of the study is to evaluate the\\nfeatures of CAD in SCH patients using coronary artery CT angiography (CTA).\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nFrom 1 April 2018 to 28 February 2020,206 consecutive patients(104 men,102 women; mean age, 71.2 ± 9.9 years) with SCH were\\nfound coronary plaques on coronary CTA. Different grades of SCH were defined by serum TSH level. The distribution and types of\\nplaques, luminal narrowing, segment involvement scores (SIS), segment stenosis scores (SSS)were evaluated and compared\\nbetween different grades of SCH and different sexes.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nPatients with grade3 SCH have less calcified plaques than grade1 SCH(0.7±0.9 vs 1.9±1.8,p=0.001),and more non-calcified\\nplaques(0.8±1.0 vs 0.4±0.8,p=0.002). As the condition of SCH aggravated, the proportion of non-calcified plaques in total plaques\\nincreased(9.3% vs 14.7% vs 27.5%, all p<0.001). The grade3 SCH has less minimal stenosis and more mild stenosis than other\\ngrades SCH(p<0.05), while SIS and SSS between different grades of SCH have no significant discrepancies(p>0.05). Multivariate\\nlogistic regression analysis demonstrated that TSH>10mU/L(OR: 8.11; 95% CI 2.89-22.75, p<0.001) and current smoking(OR: 2.77;\\n95% CI 1.02-7.52, p=0.045) were independent risk factors for the prevalence of non-calcified plaques. In different sexes groups,\\nMen with SCH had higher SIS and SSS than women(4.0±2.3 vs 3.0±2.3,p=0.004; 8.1±6.6 vs 5.5±5.1,p=0.002).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nHigh serum TSH level is associated with the incidence of non-calcified plaques in CAD patients with SCH. This may be the cause of\\npoor prognosis in patients with grade3 SCH and CAD. In addition, SCH may increase the sex differential in CAD,which also deserves\\nthe attention of clinicians.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThese findings suggested the instability and vulnerability of coronary plaques in grade3 SCH with CAD , and influence clinical\\nprognosis of such patients. Thus, hormone replacement therapy is indicated for patients with grade3 SCH to reduce the risk of\\ncardiovascular disease. Additionally, men had larger number of diseased segments and total plaque burden than women in SCH\\npatients. Further studies are warranted to confirm the sex differential in SCH with CAD.\\n\\nSSCA05-05 Association of Clinical Outcome Following Ventricular Tachycardia Ablation with Extent of Unablated\\n\\nCMR Detected Conducting Corridors on CMR-EAM Merge on Electrophysiology Navigation Platform\\n\\nParticipants\\nAvanti Gulhane, MD, Philadelphia, PA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\n\\x0cHarold I.

Late gadolinium enhancement CMR\\nmay enhance ablation targeting by identification of viable conducting corridors (CC) in scar tissue. In our experience, CMR has high\\nsensitivity but poor specificity for identification of EAM target sites during a first post MI VT ablation. Objective: To evaluate a) the\\nassociation of clinical outcomes of post MI VT ablation with additional CCs not targeted (aCC) during the index VT ablation, and b)\\nthe geographic association of aCC sites on index ablation with repeat procedure EAM target sites.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThe cohort included 50 patients retrospectively with prior MI, out of whom 14 required repeat VT ablations, for ICD shocks (n=33),\\ninducible clinical or non-clinical VT on non-invasive programmed electrical stimulation (NIPS) (n=28), deaths (2) due to VT and had\\ncontinued need for antiarrhythmic therapy for VT suppression (n=46 ). Preprocedural CMR were processed using ADAS software to\\nidentify CCs, odds ratio was calculated for adverse clinical events in patients with aCC sites recorded on merging CMR with EAM on\\nCarto navigation system after the initial ablations on a per-patient and per-channel site basis .\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe median follow up duration following index ablation was 2.75 years (IQR:1.41years). Out of 50 patients, 32(64%) had aCC sites\\non CMR-EAM merge. Of those with aCC sites, 37.5% required repeat ablations compared to 11.1% of those without aCC sites,{OR\\n4.8 (95% CI 0.93-24.6)}. Of those with aCC sites, 62.50% showed inducible VTs on NIPS as compared to 44.40% without aCCsites,\\n{OR 2.08 (95% CI 0.64 to 6.7)}. Of those with aCC, 70% had VT or NSVT episodes recorded on ICDs as compared to 50% patients\\nwithout aCC sites,{OR 3 (95% CI 0.88 to 10.1)}. 3 patients died, 2 had recurrent VT and aCC sites on CMR. On a per site basis, 14\\nof 24 (58%) repeat ablation sites matched with aCC sites on CMR.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nCMR may identify patients with higher odds for post ablation recurrent VT episodes, need for repeat ablations, and inducibility on\\nNIPS.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nAblation of unmatched LGE-CMR predicted conducting corridors on registration with EAM in heterogeneous scar of MI may have\\nimproved clinical outcome post RF ablation with fewer VT recurrence.\\n\\nSSCA05-06 Association of Pro-B-Type Natriuretic Peptide with Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Measured Global and\\n\\nRegional Cardiac Function and Structure over 10 Years: The MESA Study\\n\\nParticipants\\nAmir Ali Rahsepar, MD, Shelton, CT (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nMohammadali Habibi, MD, Los Angeles, CA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nKiang Liu, Chicago, IL (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nNadine Kawel-Boehm, MD, Seewis, Switzerland (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nBharath Ambale Venkatesh, PhD, Baltimore, MD (Abstract Co-Author) Research Grant, Canon Medical Systems Corporation Co-\\nfounder, Third Eye Knowledge\\nVeronica R.

Tagged CMR was used to calculate circumferential strain (ECC).\\nMyocardial dyssynchrony was calculated as the standard deviation of time to peak systolic strain and strain rate in all 12 segments.\\nChange in LV parameters was characterized by changes over 10 years from baseline to follow-up (year 10 - baseline). NT-proBNP\\nvalues were natural log transformed prior to modeling. Linear regression models were used to determine the relationships between\\nlog NT-proBNP and each global and regional myocardial function, extent of dyssynchrony, and 10-year change in each LV\\nparameter. Logistic regression models were used to quantify associations between log NT-proBNP and presence of myocardial scar\\ntissue at follow-up.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nOf the 2416 included participants (mean age 59 years, 49% male) the median NT-proBNP value was 46.9 pg/ml. In fully adjusted\\nmodels, 1-SD increase in baseline Log NTproBNP (1.18 pg/mL), was significantly associated with reduced LV ejection fraction\\n\\n\\x0cfunction and increased LV end-systolic volume index over 10 years. Higher baseline log NTproBNP remained independently\\nassociated with more severe global and regional (mid and apical) dyssynchronies over time after adjusting for potential risk factors.\\n1-SD increase in baseline Log NT-proBNP was also independently associated with higher odds of having myocardial scar at year 10\\n(Table).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nAmong persons without CVD, higher plasma NT-proBNP levels were associated with subclinical changes in developing myocardial\\ndysfunction, more severe cardiac dyssynchrony and higher odds of having myocardial scar over a 10-year period independent of\\ntraditional CVD risk factors.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThese results suggest that NT-proBNP concentration assessment could have important clinical implications in detecting persons\\nwith early subclinical CVD who might benefit from measures for CVD prevention.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSCA07\\n\\nCardiac (Artificial Intelligence in Cardiac Imaging)\\n\\nTuesday, Dec. 1 8:30AM - 9:30AM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nCA\\n\\nBQ AI\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .75\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSCA07-01 Improved Prognostic Value of Coronary CT Angiography-derived Plaque Information and Clinical\\n\\nParameter on Adverse Cardiac Outcome Using Machine Learning\\n\\nParticipants\\nChristian Tesche, MD , Dortmund, Germany (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nMaximilian J.

Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) more than 90 days after cCTA were recorded. Several cCTA-\\nderived plaque measures and conventional CT risk scores together with cardiovascular risk factors were provided to a ML model to\\npredict MACE. A boosted ensemble algorithm (RUSBoost) utilizing decision trees as weak learners with repeated nested cross-\\nvalidation to train and validate the model was used. Performance of the ML model was calculated using the area under the receiver\\noperating characteristic curve (AUC).\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nMACE was observed in 31 patients (8.6%) after a median follow-up of 5.4 years. Discriminatory power was significantly higher for\\nthe ML model (AUC 0.96[95%CI 0.93-0.98]) compared to conventional CT risk scores including Agatston calcium score (AUC 0.84\\n(95%CI 0.80-0.87)), segment involvement score (AUC 0.88(95%CI 0.84-0.91)), and segment stenosis score (AUC 0.89(95%CI\\n0.86-0.92),all p<0.05). Similar results were shown for plaque measures (AUCs 0.72-0.82, all p<0.05) and clinical parameters\\nincluding the Framingham risk score (AUCs 0.71-0.76, all p<0.05). The ML model yielded significantly higher diagnostic performance\\nwhen compared to logistic regression analysis (AUC 0.96vs.0.92, p=0.024).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIntegration of a ML model improves the prediction of MACE when compared to conventional CT risk scores, plaque measures and\\nclinical information. ML algorithms may improve the integration of patient\\'s information to improve risk stratification.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nML based cCTA-derived plaque quantification and characterization may have utility in risk-stratifying the vulnerability of coronary\\nlesions for the prediction of future major adverse cardiac events.\\n\\nSSCA07-02 A Machine Learning Pipeline for Segmentation and Classification of Coronary Artery Calcium Lesions\\n\\nin Lung Cancer Screening CT\\'s\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Resident\\n\\nParticipants\\nJordan Fuhrman, Chicago, IL (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nRowena Yip, MPH, New York, NY (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nArtit C.

Each artery was\\nassigned a score from 0 to 3, and the four scores are summed to produce a scan CAC score which serves as the gold standard for\\nthe deep learning algorithm.The U-Net architecture, a common biomedical segmentation network, is modified to simultaneously\\nsegment and classify CAC lesions by 1) extracting features from the expanding path of the network and 2) using feature sharing to\\nassign each lesion to one of the four arteries. CAC volume approximations are then extracted from each scan to produce a CAC\\nscore for each artery, and the scores were combined and compared to the radiologist-produced score.The diagnostic performance\\nof this approach is assessed by comparison to the radiologist-produced volume score. Further, comparison to standard U-Net\\nperformance is assessed by comparing intra-class variance for different volume score classes as well as between clinically relevant\\nsubclasses (no, mild, moderate, and severe CAC).\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nInitial testing of the novel U-Net variant using an independent test set is promising (ROC - AUC > 0.98), showing comparable\\nsegmentation performance and comparison to the radiologist score (Kendall rank correlation coefficient = 0.76).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThis novel approach to CAC segmentation and lesion classification demonstrates potential for improved diagnostic performance with\\nminimally increased computational expense. With the added benefit of classification information, additional relevant information can\\nbe extracted to better inform clinical decision-making.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nWith rapidly increasing international adoption of lung cancer screening technology, the importance of incidental disease detection\\nand diagnose is critical.\\n\\nSSCA07-03 Different Risk Factors Result in Unique Coronary Plaque Morphologies - a Longitudinal Radiomic\\n\\nAnalysis\\n\\nParticipants\\nMarton Kolossvary, MD, Boston, MA (Presenter) Developer, Radiomics Image Analysis Software\\nDavid A.

However, clinical and volume-based imaging markers may not be sensitive enough to\\nidentify differences in CAD phenotypes, and therefore may misleadingly imply that different factors result in comparable CAD\\nmorphologies and therefore propagate CAD similarly.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nIn our prospective longitudinal observational study of 300 asymptomatic individuals with coronary CT angiography (CCTA)-confirmed\\natherosclerosis (210 male, age: 48±7 years) of whom 161 were cocaine users at baseline with or without HIV-infection (226 HIV-\\ninfected), underwent CCTA at two time points (mean follow-up: 4.0±2.3 years). Precision phenotyping of CAD was done by\\ncalculating 1276 radiomic features on the 861 plaques. Linear mixed models corrected for plaque volume, high-sensitivity CRP, statin\\nuse and positive family history were used to assess the effects of cocaine use, HIV-infection and elevated atherosclerotic\\ncardiovascular disease risk (ASCVD\\x007.5%). Hierarchical clustering was used to assess potential clusters among significant radiomic\\nfeatures. Bonferroni corrected p<0.00004 (0.05/1276) was considered significant.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nOverall, 32.0% (409/1276) of the radiomic features showed significant association, of which 74.1% (303/409), 4.2% (17/409) and\\n25.4% (104/409) were affected by cocaine use, HIV-infection and elevated ASCVD risk, respectively. There was no overlap among\\nradiomic features significantly associated with increased ASCVD risk and cocaine use or HIV-infection, while 88,2% (15/17) of HIV-\\ninfection associated parameters were also affected by cocaine use. Cluster analysis indicated 13 different structural components\\namong significant features, of which eight were unique to cocaine use, three unique to ASCVD risk, and two contained parameters\\n\\n\\x0cassociated with cocaine use, elevated ASCVD risk and/or HIV-infection.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nCocaine use and HIV-infection modify different CAD morphological components than conventional cardiovascular risk factors,\\npotentially implying independent pathological pathways of disease progression.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nDifferent cardiovascular risk factors may modify coronary plaque structural progression differently, potentially implying unique\\npathological pathways of disease progression.\\n\\nSSCA07-04 Deep Neural Network Provides Expert Level Accuracy in Quantifying Thoracic Aortic Dilatation on\\n\\nContrast and Non-contrast Chest CT Scans\\n\\nParticipants\\nBasel Yacoub, MD, Charleston, SC (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nTilman S.

A DNN based on a U-Net architecture was developed using 1400 annotated chest CT datasets to automatically segment\\nthe thoracic aorta, compute its centerline and report the maximal diameters in the ascending (AA) and descending (DA) aorta on\\nplanes orthogonal to the centerline. These measurements were compared to those obtained by two expert readers on multi-planar\\nreformats using a semi-automated aortic edge detection tool. Patients\\' age, sex and abnormal aortic findings were recorded for\\neach CT scan. Inter-reader reliability and the concordance of the DNN\\'s output with the mean readers\\' measurements were\\ndetermined by using interclass correlations (ICC; single rater and absolute agreements).\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nMean age was 62.3 years (SD: 11.6) with 30.0% females. 94% of the scans had ectasias/aneurysms; 24% had dissections; 8% had\\nintramural thrombi and 8% had postoperative changes such as aortic stents or valves. There was excellent inter-reader agreement\\non diameter measurements; ICC of 0.951 (95% CI: 0.870 to 0.976). The mean of readers\\' maximal diameters was 47.5 mm and 37.7\\nmm in the AA and DA respectively. Dice coefficients, comparing output to ground truth segmentations, were 0.926 and 0.921 on\\nthe contrast and non-contrast scans, respectively. Analysis of the concordance of the DNN\\'s results with the readers\\' means on\\ncontrast CT scans showed ICC of 0.969 (95% CI: 0.965 - 0.993) in the AA and ICC of 0.882 (95% CI: 0.756 - 0.945) in the DA. On\\nnon-contrast CT scans, we obtained an ICC of 0.780 (95% CI: 0.547 - 0.901) in the AA and 0.908 (95% CI: 0.561 - 0.970) in the\\nDA.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThis DNN algorithm offers expert level accuracy for automated segmentation and quantification of thoracic aortic dilatation on\\ncontrast and non-contrast CT scans with challenging pathologies.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nA DNN algorithm offers accurate automated measurements of thoracic aortic dilatations on contrast and non-contrast CT scans in\\npatients with complicated findings on CT imaging such as ectasia/aneurysm, dissections, aortic stents and mural thrombi.\\n\\nSSCA07-05 Radiomics Differentiate Left Atrial Appendage Thrombi and Mixing Artifacts on Dynamic CT\\n\\nAngiography Images\\n\\nParticipants\\nShadi Ebrahimian, Boston, MA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nFatemeh Homayounieh, MD, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nAndrew Primak, PhD, Cleveland, OH (Abstract Co-Author) Employee, Siemens AG\\nFelix Lades, Forchheim, Germany (Abstract Co-Author) Employee, Siemens AG\\nSandeep S.

We assessed if radiomics can differentiate between LAA contrast mixing\\nartifact and thrombus without the need for delayed images.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nOur IRB-approved retrospective study included 89 patients who underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced, ECG-gated cardiac or\\npulmonary vein CT. Of these, 59 patients had filling defects in the LAA consistent with thrombi (n= 29, mean age: 70.10 ± 12.61\\nyears, M: F 14:15) or LAA contrast-mixing artifacts (n= 30, mean age: 70.56 ± 12.01 years, M: F 19:11) on the 1-minute delayed\\nphase CT images through the heart. The remaining 30 patients (mean age: 65.9 ± 10.44 years, M: F 18:12) had homogeneous\\nopacification without filling defects of LAA (normal). LAA on dynamic CECT images was manually segmented to obtain first and\\nhigher order radiomics (eXamine, Siemens) for all 89 patients. Mean HU values with in the LAA was also recorded. The data were\\nanalyzed using multivariate logistic regression with receiver operator characteristics area under the curve (AUC) to determine the\\naccuracy of features.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe second order radiomics such as gray level run length matrix (GLRLM), gray level dependence matrix (GLDM), gray level co-\\noccurrence matrix (GLCM), and gray level size zone matrix (GLSZM) enabled differentiation of LAA artifacts and thrombus in patients\\nwith LAA filling defects on dynamic CCECT images (AUC=0.88). The best differentiators of artifacts from normal LAA second-order\\nradiomics feature (GLCM) with an AUC of 0.98 (p<0.0001). Kurtosis, GLCM, and GLDM were identified as the best differentiators of\\nnormal LAA from thrombus with an AUC of 0.99.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nRadiomics can differentiate between LAA thrombi and contrast mixing artifacts on dynamic contrast-enhanced CT images without\\nneed for delayed phase images.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nRadiomics can help reduce radiation dose by avoiding need for delayed phase CT images in patients with LAA filling defects on\\ndynamic contrast-enhanced CT images.\\n\\nSSCA07-06 Automatic Prediction of Left Cardiac Chamber Enlargement on Chest Radiographs Using\\n\\nConvolutional Neural Network\\n\\nParticipants\\nJu G.

For training and internal validation, 630 CRs (349 normal and 281 LAE-radiographs) and 460 CRs\\n(286 normal and 174 LVE-radiographs) matched with the same day-echocardiography were collected from 791 individuals from June\\n2018 to May 2019, respectively. External validation was performed using 94 temporally independent CRs (26 normal, 51 with LAE, 12\\nwith LVE, and 5 with both). Reader performance test was conducted using the external validation dataset by three cardiothoracic\\nradiologists, without and with the results of DLCE in a 4 week-interval. Classification performance of DLCE was evaluated and\\ncompared with those of the readers and conventional radiographic features, including cardiothoracic ratio, carinal angle, and double\\ncontour. In addition, DLCE-LAE was tested on 5,277 CRs from a healthcare screening program cohort.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nDLCE-LAE showed area-under-the receiver-operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.862 and 0.823 on internal and external\\nvalidation, respectively. On reader performance test, DLCE-LAE showed better results than pooled radiologists (AUROC 0.823 vs.\\n0.691; P<.001) and significantly increased their performance when used as a second reader (pooled AUROC 0.691 vs. 0.752;\\nP=.004). DLCE-LAE also showed significantly higher AUROC than conventional radiographic findings (AUROC 0.823 vs. 0.537-0.742;\\nall Ps<.05). In the healthcare screening cohort, DLCE-LAE successfully detected 71.0% (22/31) radiographs with severe LAE, while\\nyielding a minor 0.6% (26/4184) false-positive rate. DLCE-LVE showed AUROCs of 0.946 and 0.639 on internal and external\\nvalidation datasets, respectively.\\n\\n\\x0cCONCLUSION\\n\\nDLCE-LAE outperformed cardiothoracic radiologists in detecting LAE and showed promise in screening individuals with severe LAE in\\nan annual healthcare screening cohort. DLCE-LVE failed to show clinically significant performance.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nLeft atrial enlargement is well known factor related to patients\\' survival, and thus automatic detection of LAE can facilitate\\npatients\\' diagnosis of cardiac diseases and improve their prognosis.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSCH03\\n\\nScience Session with Keynote: Chest (COVID-19 Imaging and Lung Infection)\\n\\nSunday, Nov. 29 3:30PM - 4:30PM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nCH CT NM AI\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .50\\n\\nFDA  Discussions may include off-label uses.\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSCH03-01 Chest Keynote Speaker: COVID-19 Imaging\\n\\nParticipants\\nMichael Chung, MD, New York, NY (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nSSCH03-02 Transfer Deep Learning for Tuberculosis Detection on Chest X-Ray Images Captured by Phone\\n\\nCamera\\n\\nParticipants\\nPo-Chih Kuo, Hsinchu City, Taiwan (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nCheng-Che Tsai, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nLeo Anthony Celi, Cambridge, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nkuopc@mit.edu\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nAn early diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) is crucial but is challenging for resource-poor countries with a shortage of radiologists. An\\napproach to solve this obstacle is to take photographs on chest X-ray (CXR) and interpret them using smartphones. We developed\\na transfer deep learning-based TB detection model (TBShoNet) for CXR photographs taken by a phone camera.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThree publicly available datasets, MIMIC-CXR, Montgomery, and Shenzhen were used for model pretraining, transferring, and\\nevaluation, respectively. The 121-layer neural network was pretrained on MIMIC-CXR database containing 250,044 CXRs with 14\\npulmonary labels, which did not include TB. The model was then recalibrated for CXR photographs by using simulation methods to\\naugment the dataset. Finally, the TBShoNet was built by connecting the pretrained model to an additional 2-layer neural network\\ntrained on augmented CXR images in Montgomery dataset (TB: 58; normal: 80). The photographs taken by five different phones\\nfrom the CXRs in Shenzhen dataset (TB: 336; normal: 326) were used to test the model performance. Diagnostic performance was\\nmeasured using area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for image-wise classification.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nTBShoNet demonstrated an AUC of 0.89 (confidence interval: 0.87-0.91) for TB detection. With optimal cutoff, sensitivity and\\nspecificity for classification were 81% and 84%, respectively.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nBased on transfer learning and data augmentation, TBShoNet was built without training on TB CXR photographs. TBShoNet can\\ndetect TB on phone-captured CXR photographs and generalize across different datasets.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nTBShoNet provides a method to develop an algorithm that can be deployed on phones to assist healthcare providers in areas where\\nradiologists and high-resolution digital images are unavailable.\\n\\nSSCH03-04 Artificial Intelligence Deep Learning with Chest CT to Predict Outcomes Such as ICU Admission in\\n\\nCOVID-19: A Multinational Study\\n\\nParticipants\\nZiyue Xu, PhD, Reston, VA (Presenter) Researcher, NVIDIA Corporation\\nSheng Xu, PhD, Bethesda, MD (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nStephanie A.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) deep learning has the potential to aid in automated and standardized evaluation\\nof CT scans. This work aims to investigate the potential of 3D deep learning method to predict clinical outcomes of patients with\\nCOVID-19, based on chest CT.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\n632 chest CTs in patients with PCR-proven COVID-19 were correlated with the clinical outcome of admission to an ICU (N=69) or no\\nadmission to an ICU (N=563). An automated whole lung segmentation algorithm was developed and used to localize whole lung.\\nBased on the local region-of-interest around the lung (a bounding box), a 3D deep learning-based algorithm for classification of\\nclinical outcome labels were trained with 5-fold cross validation. Model performance for classification on chest CT was evaluated by\\noverall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nClassification models achieved overall accuracy of 92%, sensitivity 73%, and specificity 93.9%, despite an imbalanced dataset\\nweighted towards no ICU admission. The positive predictive value for predicting ICU admission was only 53%, but the negative\\npredictive value was 97%. Such a model might alert the clinician to the enhanced potential of ICU admission, when combined with\\nother clinical features.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nBased upon Chest CT alone, AI-based deep learning algorithms can reasonably predict clinical outcomes such as ICU admission, in\\npatients with COVID-19 who underwent CT and PCR on the day of admission. The model is feasible with reasonable accuracy and\\nspecificity of prediction. The current study should be interpreted with caution and is preliminary and limited in its unbalanced data,\\nsmall number of positive cases, single site, and lack of inclusion of standard clinical metrics, all of which have significant impact on\\nstatistical interpretation.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nIt is possible for an AI algorithm (based upon an initial admission chest CT alone) to predict clinical outcome measures such as later\\nICU admission.\\n\\nSSCH03-05 Diagnostic Performance of CT for COVID-19 Pneumonia in High-prevalence versus Low-prevalence\\n\\nDisease Scenarios\\n\\nParticipants\\nMarcello Petrini, Piacenza, Italy (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nDavide Colombi, MD, Piacenza, Italy (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nGabriele Maffi, Milano, Italy (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nGabriele D.

We evaluated two different epidemic phases that\\noccurred in our hospital localized in Italy: the first period of high prevalence disease (High prevalence group, HPG), from 21st\\nFebruary to 7th March; a second period with reduced prevalence (low prevalence group, LPG) from 6th to 13th April, after 28 days\\nof lockdown. RT-PCR result was used as reference standard to calculate CT sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV)\\nand negative predictive value (NPV) in two periods.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe HPG included 198 patients (females 63/198, 32%; median age, 69) while LPG included 146 patients (females 76/146, 52%;\\nmedian age, 70), without significative difference for age but with significative male predominance in the first group. Positive RT-PCR\\nrate was 89% (177/198) in HPG and 31% (45/146) in LPG. In HPG, CT sensitivity for COVID-19 pneumonia was 94% (95%CI, 90-\\n97%), specificity 63% (40-82%), PPV 95% (92-97%), NPV 58% (41-73%). In the LPG, CT sensitivity was 93% (82-98%),\\nspecificity 73% (64-82%), PPV 61% (53-68%), NPV 96% (89-99%).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nFor COVID-19 pneumonia CT sensitivity is high (93-94%), whilst specificity is low (73-63%). However, given a negative CT, the\\nlikelihood to have COVID-19 pneumonia is 42% (NPV, 58%) during the high prevalence phase of the disease while it is 4% (NPV,\\n96%) in the low prevalence period.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nClinicians faced different clinical scenario in few days, due to pandemic spread of COVID-19. PPV and NPV of chest CT should drive\\nclinical management of patient suspected for COVID-19.\\n\\nSSCH03-06 Quantification of Airspace Disease Associated with COVID-19: Proposal of a Novel Method Correlating\\n\\nChest CT and Chest X-Ray Quantification through Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs\\n\\nParticipants\\nEduardo J.

We developed a novel method to quantify AD in chest X-ray\\nbased on chest CT.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nOur reference standard is CT derived 3D quantification of percentage of lung volume involved by AD (ground glass opacities and\\nconsolidations), via a neural network algorithm trained on 1000 chest CTs in patients with COVID-19 (%volCT). Our method\\ngenerates digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) by forward projections through the CT volume along the AP axis, processed via\\na super-resolution neural network. Our test data comprised 24 patients with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19 who underwent chest\\nCT and chest X-ray less than 24 hours apart. CT derived 3D total lung and airspace disease segmentation was projected on the\\nDRRs using quantitative maps of cumulative thickness of both lung tissue and AD through the anterior-posterior axis, adjusted to\\nminimize the mean squared error between %volCT and the percentage area of AD (%areaDRR) computed in DRRs. Finally, 2 expert\\nthoracic radiologists with over 10 years\\' experience independently manually segmented AD in the paired chest x-rays, whose results\\nwere averaged to generate a consensus percentage area of AD (%areaCXR).\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nCT derived volumetric AD quantification (%volCT) mean was 24.3%, median 13.8% (range 0 - 77.3%); DRR derived area AD\\nquantification (%areaDRR) mean was 24.4%, median 8.9% (range 0 - 81.8%); expert consensus on chest x-rays (%areaCXR) mean\\nwas 12.3%, median 8.3% (range 0 - 53.0%). Pearson correlation between %volCT and %areaDRR was 0.99 (p < .00001), between\\nthe 2 expert readers was 0.86 (p < .00001), between %volCT and %areaCXR was 0.70 (p < .001), and between %areaDRR and\\n%areaCXR was 0.69 (p < .001). Figure 1 illustrates results in 3 representative patients.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe correlation between %volCT and %areaDRR was excellent. Expert readers underestimated the extent of AD on chest x-rays\\nwhen compared to CT based volumetric and DRR based area quantification of AD, with moderate correlation between %areaDRR and\\n%areaCXR.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nOur novel method may allow more accurate assessment of AD extent in chest x-rays, better correlating with the reference\\nstandard of chest CT, impacting diagnostic and prognostic evaluation of suspected COVID-19 patients.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSCH04\\n\\nScience Session with Keynote: Chest (Applications of AI and Radiomics in Lung Imaging)\\n\\nTuesday, Dec. 1 10:00AM - 11:00AM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nCH CT OI AI\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .75\\n\\nFDA  Discussions may include off-label uses.\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSCH04-01 Chest Keynote Speaker: The Role of Artificial Intelligence in Lung Cancer Screening\\n\\nParticipants\\nColin Jacobs, PhD, Nijmegen, Netherlands (Presenter) Research Grant, MeVis Medical Solutions AGRoyalties, MeVis Medical Solutions\\nAGResearch Grant, Thirona\\n\\nSSCH04-02 Deep Learning for Lung Nodule Malignancy Prediction: Comparison With Clinicians and the Brock\\n\\nModel on an Independent Dataset From a Large Lung Screening Trial\\n\\nParticipants\\nKiran Vaidhya Venkadesh, MSc, Nijmegen, Netherlands (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nArnaud A.

The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of a deep learning system\\nthat was trained using subjective labels from LIDC-IDRI by testing it on two independent datasets of nodules from the Danish Lung\\nCancer Screening Trial (DLCST) with histopathological proof or follow-up over a period of at least 2 years, and comparing\\nperformance with a panel of 11 clinicians and the clinically established Brock risk model.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nWe considered nodules annotated by at least 3 out of 4 radiologists from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. The malignancy ratings were\\naveraged and indeterminate nodules were excluded resulting in 680 nodules (352 benign and 328 malignant) for development. We\\ntrained a deep learning system based on 2D multi-view CNN and 3D extension of VGGNet on the development set. We tested the\\nsystem on two sets of nodules from DLCST. The first set, dataset A, consisted of 62 cancers and 120 random benign nodules and\\nthe second set, dataset B, consisted of the same 62 cancers and a size-matched group of 118 benign nodules. A group of 11\\nclinicians, consisting of 4 radiologists, 5 radiology residents, and 2 pulmonologists, were tasked with grading the nodules on a\\ncontinuous scale from 0 to 100. Finally, the Brock risk model was also applied to all nodules.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nOn dataset A, the deep learning system produced an AUC of 0.941, which is better than the average clinician (0.892, p = 0.02) and\\ncomparable to the Brock model (0.924, p = 0.35). On dataset B, the system produced an AUC of 0.737, which is comparable to the\\nBrock model (0.70, p = 0.268) but worse than the average clinician (0.80, p = 0.034).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe deep learning system trained with subjective labels performed comparably with humans and the Brock model but showed\\ncertain vulnerabilities when presented with large benign nodules. It is important to recognize the challenges involved in classifying\\nindeterminate lung nodules and we think the field would benefit from publicly available datasets with a reference standard set by\\nhistopathological proof or follow-up.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nAlgorithms for nodule malignancy prediction may improve clinical follow-up decisions in lung cancer screening and clinical work-up.\\n\\nSSCH04-03 Development of Deep Learning Algorithm Detecting Nine Common Abnormalities on Chest\\n\\nRadiographs: Validation compared with Radiologists and Simulation Study to Evaluate Reading Time\\nin Emergency Radiology\\n\\nParticipants\\nJu G.

External validation was performed using an\\nopen dataset (PadChest, n=673) and a same day CT-confirmed dataset (n=190; normal:abnormal=53:147) independent from\\ntraining set, and compared with three thoracic radiologists. Simulation test was conducted on another independent dataset, of\\nwhich the disease-distribution was matched to emergency room setting: 146 nonurgent, 52 urgent (20 pneumonia, 11 malignancy,\\n7 pleural effusion, 6 pulmonary edema, 4 tuberculosis, 3 interstitial lung disease, and 1 rib fracture), and 4 critical (2 pneumothorax,\\n1 aortic dissection, and 1 pneumoperitoneum) cases. Six radiologists (2 thoracic, 2 general, and 2 residents) interpreted the images\\ntwice, with and without DLAD, in a 4-week interval. Time consumed for interpretation of each CR was recorded.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nDLAD exhibited AUROCs of 0.913-0.997 on PadChest dataset and 0.911-1.00 on CT-confirmed dataset for nine abnormalities. When\\nabnormalities were classified into critical (Ptx, MW, and Ppm), urgent (Ndl, Csn, and Pef), and nonurgent (others) findings, DLAD\\nsuccessfully classified significantly more cases with critical or urgent findings (97.3%[107/110] vs. 89.7%[296/330]; P=.02) than\\npooled three radiologists. On the simulation test, pooled radiologists detected significantly more critical (29.2%[7/24] vs. 70.8%\\n[17/24]; P=.006) and urgent (78.2%[244/312] vs. 83.3%[260/312]; P=.03) diseases aided by DLAD. All readers decreased time\\nconsumed for nonurgent CR-interpretation (P<.001), and most (4/6) readers decreased total interpretation time.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nDLAD showed better performance than radiologists in detecting critical or urgent findings from CRs, and radiologists improved their\\nperformance and reading time aided by DLAD.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nDLAD, as an interpretation-assistance covering most radiographic findings, could vastly help radiologists in routine practice not only\\nfor detection performance but also by reducing reading-time.\\n\\nSSCH04-04 Aiding Diagnosis of Interstitial Lung Disease Applying Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) of\\n\\nSimilar CTs With Confirmed Diagnosis Based on Extent and Distribution of Regional Disease Pattern\\n\\nParticipants\\nJooae Choe, MD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nHye Jeon Hwang, MD,PhD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJoon Beom Seo, MD, PhD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nSang Min Lee, MD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJihye Yun, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nRohee Park, MD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJihoon Kim, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nKiok Jin, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nYoungsoo Lee, Suwon, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJewon Jeong, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nHowook Jeon, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nNamkug Kim, PhD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Stockholder, Anymedi, Inc\\nJaeyoun Yi, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Officer, Coreline Soft, Co Ltd; Stockholder, Coreline Soft, Co Ltd\\nDonghoon Yu, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Employee, Coreline Soft, Co Ltd\\nByeongsoo Kim, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Employee, Coreline Soft, Co Ltd\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\numttette@hanmail.net\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo investigate whether content-based image retrieval (CBIR) of similar chest CT images can aid the diagnosis of interstitial lung\\ndisease (ILD) in readers with different levels of experience.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nA total of 296 cases of ILD CT were included in the database of the proposed CBIR system. Data consisted of four disease classes:\\nusual interstitial pneumonia (UIP, n=100), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP, n=101), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP,\\nn=45) and chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (CHP, n=50). Eighty cases (30 UIP, 30 NSIP, 10 COP and 10 CHP) were selected as\\nquery from the CBIR system. The top three similar chest CTs were retrieved from the database by assessing and comparing the\\nextent and distribution of six different regional disease patterns (normal looking lung, ground glass opacity, reticulation,\\nhoneycombing, consolidation and emphysema), which were automatically quantified and classified by convolutional neural network.\\nEight readers including two residents, three pulmonologists, and three radiologists interpreted CT images of query cases and\\n\\n\\x0cprovided their most probable diagnosis among five diseases (UIP, NSIP, COP, CHP and smoking-related ILD) and rated the\\nconfidence level of diagnosis (high, intermediate and low) on two different session of reading before and after applying CBIR.\\nDiagnostic accuracy (rate of correct diagnosis), inter-reader agreement and confidence level were analyzed.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nAfter applying CBIR, the accuracy of probable diagnosis increased in all eight readers (rate of correct diagnosis: pre-CBIR, mean\\n46%[range 38-58%]; post-CBIR, 61%[69-93%]) and the improvement was significant in five readers including one resident, two\\npulmonologists, and two radiologists (P=0.001-0.049). The improvement of accuracy was significant in UIP and NSIP cases\\n(P=0.001-0.031). Inter-reader agreement increased after using CBIR (Fleiss\\' kappa: pre-CBIR, 0.32; post-CBIR, 0.47). Confidence\\nlevel increased after using CBIR (percentage of high confidence level: pre-CBIR, 15.1%; post-CBIR, 27.6%, P=0.05).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nUsage of CBIR system of ILD CT improved the diagnostic accuracy of ILD and inter-reader agreement in readers with different levels\\nof experience.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThe proposed CBIR system may assist the diagnosis of ILD in clinical practice regardless of the level of experience.\\n\\nSSCH04-05 Deep Learning-Based Assessment of Body Composition in Patients With Lung Cancer\\n\\nParticipants\\nJakob Weiss, MD, Boston, MA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nChristopher Bridge, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Institutional support, NVIDIA CorporationInstitutional support, General Electric\\nCompanyInstitutional support, Nuance Communications, Inc\\nJunwei Lu, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nCamden P.

To account for demographic differences, body composition measures were normalized with respect to race,\\nage and sex based on z-scores calculated in a general outpatient population of >12,000 individuals. To investigate the association\\nof body composition with overall survival, the lowest tertile of the normalized measures was used to define patients as having low\\nmuscle mass or low TAT. Cox proportional hazard models were adjusted for demographics, body mass index, cancer and treatment\\ncharacteristics.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nBody composition was successfully quantified in all patients. Over a median follow-up of 1.8 years (event rate: 68.1% (877/1,287)),\\noverall survival was significantly associated with a higher mortality in patients with low muscle mass (HR: 1.32; 95% CI, 1.13-1.54;\\np<0.001) and patients with low TAT (HR: 1.27; 95% CI, 1.07-1.50; p=0.005) compared to the reference groups. Stratified analyses\\nsuggest that these associations are driven by younger patients (<65-years-old; p<=0.004), early stages of disease (I/II;\\np<=0.005) and patients with adenocarcinoma (p<=0.04).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIn patients with lung cancer, low muscle mass and low TAT quantified on CT at time of diagnosis are independently associated with\\noverall survival, especially in younger patients with early stage disease. Deep learning allows for a reliable and automatic extraction\\nof these currently unused information, which may offer an approach to guide clinical decision-making and improve patient\\nmanagement in large cohorts.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nAutomatic quantification of body composition on routine abdominal CT scans identifies patients with lung cancer at high risk beyond\\nestablished markers and may help to optimize patient care.\\n\\nSSCH04-06 Impact of Real-time Implementation of Artificial Intelligence Bone Processing on Chest Radiographs\\n\\nin a Large Academic Practice\\n\\nParticipants\\nReece J.

Of these, 5,779 (42%) were also processed (P-CXR) with bone suppression (BS) and\\nbone isolation (BI) software prior clinical interpretation. Reports by 32 attending radiologists working in thoracic and emergency\\nradiology were blindly reviewed for findings (opacities >6 mm) and specific imaging recommendations. Test metrics for novel findings\\nwere calculated for CXRs in the study period without prior thoracic imaging within one year and with following chest computed\\ntomography (CT) within 3 weeks as the gold standard (n=554, 4%). Statistics from generalized linear modeling are presented as\\nparameter estimate [95% confidence interval], p<0.05 considered statistically significant.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nMean patient age ± standard deviation was 63 ± 16 years; 55% male. The recommendation rate was 7 [6-8]% with no significant\\ndifference between S-CXR and P-CXR, odds ratio (OR) 0.9 [0.7-1.1], p=0.32. In CXRs with no recent prior comparison, there was\\nno difference in sensitivity (49 [44-54]%, p=0.95), specificity (51 [43-58]%, p=0.6), negative predictive value (NPV) (29 [24-\\n34]%, p=0.13), or accuracy (49 [45-53]%, p=0.8). S-CXR positive predictive value (PPV) was 65 [58-43]% compared to P-CXR 77\\n[69-84]%; OR 1.8 [1.1-3.2] (p=0.031). The false positive rate was lower in P-CXR (11 [7-15]%) compared to S-CXR (17 [14-\\n22]%), OR 0.6 [0.3-0.9], p=0.02. The effect was most pronounced for emergency radiologists with a P-CXR PPV 93 [83-98]%\\ncompared to S-CXR 77 [65-87]%, OR 1.2 [1.0-1.3] (p=0.023).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nDigitally processing chest radiographs (BS and BI) increased positive predictive value compared to unprocessed radiographs by\\ndecreasing the rate of false positive findings without affecting follow-up imaging recommendations or other test metrics including\\nsensitivity, specificity, NPV, or accuracy. The effect is more pronounced in emergency radiology compared to thoracic radiology.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nArtificial intelligence bone processing can be used to increase true positive findings in chest radiography without affecting other\\ntest metrics or increasing recommendation rate for follow-up imaging\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSCH05\\n\\nChest (Lung Cancer Screening)\\n\\nThursday, Dec. 3 2:00PM - 3:00PM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nCH CT OI\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .75\\n\\nFDA  Discussions may include off-label uses.\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSCH05-01 Lung Cancer Screening Among Screening Mammography Patients: Bicoastal Eligibility, Knowledge\\n\\nand Interest at Two Urban Academic Centers\\n\\nParticipants\\nEitan Novogrodsky, MD, Kew Gardens, NY (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nHannah Milch, MD, Santa Monica, CA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nGeraldine M.

The purpose of this study is to determine\\nLCS eligibility, knowledge, and interest among women presenting for screening mammography (SM).\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nA single-page survey (English or Spanish) was distributed to all patients presenting for SM from January-March 2020 at 6 sites\\nwithin two urban academic medical centers on the East and West Coasts. The East Coast general patient population has a higher\\npoverty rate, greater ethnic and racial diversity, and higher Medicare and Medicaid rates compared to the West Coast population.\\nSurvey questions included: age, smoking history, LCS knowledge, compliance, and interest. LCS eligibility was determined based on\\nUSPSTF guidelines. Descriptive statistics were calculated for cumulative responses, as well as Student\\'s t-tests and chi-square\\ntests for comparing data between the two medical centers.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nOf 1000 completed surveys, 233 (23.3%) women reported a history of smoking (25 current, 199 former, 9 undetermined). Of those\\nwith a smoking history, 12 (5.2%) met LCS criteria and 23 (9.9%) were borderline eligible or would become eligible upon turning 55\\nyears old. Of the 35 eligible or borderline eligible women, 22 (62.9%) had never heard of LCS, and 28 (80%) expressed interest in\\nLCS. Among eligible patients, 4 (33%) had received a screening LDCT. Among all current and former smokers, 44 (18.9%) had heard\\nof LCS. The East Coast medical center demonstrated a significantly higher rate of current smokers and LCS eligibility. Among LCS\\neligible and borderline eligible patients, there was no significant difference in LCS knowledge, compliance, or interest between the\\ntwo centers.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nA quarter of women presenting for screening mammography had a history of smoking, 1 in 7 were eligible or borderline/soon-to-be\\neligible for LCS, yet the majority (62.9%) had never heard of LCS. The SM population represents a promising yet untapped\\nopportunity to educate and screen female smokers and save lives from lung cancer.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nGiven their interest in cancer screening, the approximately 30 million women per year who undergo mammography represent an\\nimportant yet untapped opportunity to expand lung cancer screening.\\n\\nSSCH05-02 The Impact of Social Determinants of Health on Lung Cancer Screening Utilization\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Resident\\n\\nParticipants\\nDonghoon Shin, MD, Boston, MA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nMichael Ngo, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJeffrey Wang, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nMichael D.

All lung cancer screening CT\\nappointments scheduled at the Boston Medical Center and its affiliates between Jan 1, 2015 and Dec 31, 2018 were identified from\\nthe Electronic Medical Records (EMR). Missed vs. completed status for the appointments were obtained Radiology Information\\nSystems. Demographics, insurance type, and SDH information were obtained from the EMR. SDH variables included housing, food,\\nmedication, transportation, and employment insecurities, difficulty arranging child/elder care, or paying for utilities, and interest in\\nmore education. Fisher\\'s exact test was used for the evaluation of unadjusted association between the SDHs and visit status.\\nMultivariate logistic regression was used for multivariate analyses.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nA total of 4755 lung cancer screening CT appointments for 1365 patients were identified. Insurance payors at each appointment\\nwere 27.0% Medicare, 20.7% Medicaid, and 21.7% private or other kind of insurance. In unadjusted analysis, insurance type and\\nhousing insecurity were associated with missed appointments with statistical significance (p < 0.0001 and 0.014,\\nrespectively).Multivariate analysis showed that the significant association between housing and missed appointments disappeared\\nwhen adjusted for the insurance type. Transportation insecurity and insurance type were significantly associated with missed\\nappointments in multivariate analysis. The odds of missing the appointment was 47.5% higher in patients with transport insecurity\\n(p = 0.045). The odds of missing the appointment was 5.68 times higher in patients with Medicaid when compared to those with\\nprivate insurance (p < 0.0001) and 4.01 times higher when compared to those with Medicare (p < 0.0001). There was no significant\\ndifference between Medicare and private insurance patients.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nTransportation insecurity and Medicaid insurance type were associated with missed lung cancer screening CT appointments with\\nstatistical significance.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nIdentifying social determinants of health associated with missed imaging opportunities, such as lung cancer screening CT, may\\nassist in targeted interventions that could improve healthcare utilization and positive clinical outcomes.\\n\\nSSCH05-03 Cost-effectiveness of Treatment Thresholds for Subsolid Pulmonary Nodules in a Lung Cancer\\n\\nScreening Program\\n\\nParticipants\\nMark M.

Nodules would grow and\\ndevelop solid components over time. We varied the thresholds for Lung-RADS 4B/4X nodules, specifically the thresholds of (a)\\ngrowth rate for pure ground-glass nodules (GGNs) > 30 mm and (b) solid component size within a growing part-solid nodule (PSN).\\nFor each threshold, we computed average costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) per patient and identified the incremental\\ncost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) of those on the efficient frontier.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nFor growing GGNs, the efficient frontier (Figure 1) included a threshold of \\x00 3 mm/year growth and a strategy of never treating\\nsuch nodules; for growing PSNs, the efficient frontier included solid component size thresholds of 4 mm, 5 mm, 8 mm, and 10 mm.\\nThe strategy that was most cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000/QALY was an 8 mm threshold for PSN\\nsolid component and never treating growing GGNs, with an ICER of $67,150. These findings were stable across a range of sensitivity\\nanalyses.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nTherapy for pure GGN is likely not cost effective. Increasing the threshold of treatment for PSNs to require larger solid component\\nsizes improves cost effectiveness of a lung cancer screening program.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nExisting Lung-RADS thresholds for treating growing GGNs and PSNs may be too low and result in overtreatment of these lesions.\\n\\nSSCH05-04 Management of Nodules Attached to the Costal Pleura on LDCT Lung Cancer Screening\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Fellow\\n\\n\\x0cParticipants\\nYe Qing Zhu, New York, NY (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nRowena Yip, MPH, New York, NY (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nNan You, New York, NY (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nClaudia I.

Total 575\\nparticipants with 951 solid cP-NCNs with average diameter>=3.0mm were identified. Retrospective review documented the following\\nfeatures: nodule size, location, margin (smooth or non-smooth), shape (round, oval/hemisphere, geometric or other), nodule-pleura\\ninterface (broad or narrow), peri-nodular emphysema and fibrosis.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nOf the 575 participants, most (n=351, 61.0%) had a single cP-NCN, 136 (23.7%) had 2 cP-NCNs, and 88 (15.3%) had 3 to 14 cP-\\nNCNs. After follow-up for median 7 years, 11 cases with lung cancer in cP-NCNs were found; The average diameter was <10.0mm\\nfor 4 (36.4%), 10.0-14.9mm for 4 (36.4%), and >- 15.0 for 3 (27.3%). No lung cancer was found in solid cP-NCNs had smooth\\nmargin and oval or hemisphere shape in size group <10mm. All 4 lung cancers in baseline cP-NCNs with average diameter less than\\n10.0 mm were diagnosed years later (range of 1.5 to 4.9 years) and were still in stage I when diagnosed. All 4 lung cancers were\\ndiagnosed within 1 year of baseline LDCT were larger than 10.0 mm and had non-smooth margin, shape rather than round,\\noval/hemisphere or geometric, and had peri-nodular emphysema. Features of cP-NCN associated with a higher risk of lung cancer\\nwere nodule location (p=0.01), increasing nodule size (p<0.0001), narrow nodule-pleura attachment (p=0.02), non-smooth margin\\n(p<0.0001), other shape (p<0.0001) and peri-nodular emphysema (p<0.0001).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nOn baseline LDCT, cP-NCNs with an average diameter < 10.0 mm, smooth margin and oval or hemisphere shape were significantly\\nmore likely to be benign and for them annual follow-up is recommended.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nSolid costal juxtapleural nodules with smooth margin, an oval or hemisphere shape and an average diameter less than 10 mm are\\nsignificantly more likely to be benign and for them annual follow-up is recommended.\\n\\nSSCH05-05 Review of Lung-RADS 4A and 4B Nodules on Lung Cancer Screening CTs at an Urban Safety-net\\n\\nHospital: Is There a Role for Further Risk Stratification?\\n\\nParticipants\\nNeha Khemani, MD, Boston, MA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nKatrina Steiling, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nHristina Natcheva, MD, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nKei Suzuki, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nAnuradha Rebello, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nLung Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) estimates that the risk of cancer ranges from 5-15% for RADS 4A nodules\\nand >15 % for RADS 4B nodules. Per guidelines, RADS 4 nodules are downgraded to RADS 2 if 3 month stability is demonstrated.\\nThis study aims to assess the long-term behavior and proportion of malignancy in Lung-RADS 4A and 4B nodules in the racially and\\nsocioeconomically diverse population of a safety-net hospital.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nRetrospective analysis was performed on patients at our institution with a Lung-RADS 4 finding from 2015 to 2019 (n=313). Lesions\\ngreater than 3 cm were excluded. Cases without pathology and/or 2-year follow up imaging were excluded. Features of the index\\nnodule were recorded including location, size, margin, and density. Behavior of the index nodule was assessed on 3-month\\ndiagnostic CT, PET-CT scan, 1 and 2-year screening CT when available. Nodules with positive biopsy results were deemed\\ncancerous. Nodules that demonstrated decrease in size/resolution or 2-year stability were deemed noncancerous.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\n182 scans met inclusion criteria. 109 had 4A findings and 73 had 4B findings.43/109 (39%) 4A findings resolved at 24 months follow\\nup. All 43 nodules resolved at 3 month follow up CT. 24/109 (22%) 4A cases were subsequently diagnosed with cancer (68% had a\\npositive PET scan) 22/73 (30%) 4B findings resolved at 24 months follow up. 20/22 (91%) 4B nodules resolved at 3 months. 43/73\\n(59%) 4B cases were diagnosed as cancer (79% had a positive PET scan).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nOur findings suggest that the rate of lung cancer for LungRADS 4A findings is higher at our urban safety-net hospital. These\\nfindings also suggests a need to evaluate the utility of further stratifying 4A nodules into lower-risk nodules that can be\\ndowngraded to RADS 2 and safely return to screening in 12 months, and higher-risk nodules that should not be downgraded to\\nRADS 2 despite stability on 3 month imaging. The observation that 30% of 4B findings resolved, the vast majority within 3 months,\\nsuggests that short interval follow up, rather than biopsy may be reasonable for a subset of 4B lesions.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nFurther risk stratification of Lung RADS 4A and 4B nodules may increase the effectiveness of lung cancer screening and decrease\\n\\n\\x0cthe need for invasive diagnostic testing.\\n\\nSSCH05-06 Comparison of Lung-RADS v1.0 with Lung-RADS v1.1 Categories Using CT Nodules from the National\\n\\nLung Screening Trial\\n\\nParticipants\\nJulia Kastner, BS, Fairfax Station, VA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nRydhwana Hossain, MD, New York, NY (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJean Jeudy JR, MD, Baltimore, MD (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nFarouk Dako, MD,MPH, Philadelphia, PA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nVarun Mehta, MD, Brooklyn, NY (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nSandeep Dalal, Cambridge, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Employee, Koninklijke Philips NV\\nEkta N.

We randomly selected 4,408 nodules (4078 solid, 82 mixed and 248 GGN) among 2,813 patients\\nwho underwent low dose CT in the NLST. 1100 patients whose largest solid nodule was >= 6mm to < 10mm in diameter were further\\nreviewed on the prevalence NLST CT scans to determine if they were perifissural or non-perifissural according to the de Hoop et al\\nclassification system, enabling downgrading to category 2. GGNs were assessed for size between 20mm-<30mm also enabling\\ndowngrading to category 2. This project received an IRB exemption.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nOf the 1100 largest patient nodules that were >= 6mm to < 10mm (category 3 or 4A in LungRADS v1.0), 215 (19.5%) were\\nreclassified as perifissural (category 2 in LungRADS v1.1) or 215/4079 (5.3%) of all solid nodule CTs. None of the reclassified\\nperifissural nodules proved to be malignant. Of the initial 248 GGNs, 243 GGNs were categorized as category 2 and five categorized\\nas category 3 using Lung RADS v1.0 criteria, of which 4/5 (80%) were reclassified from category 3 to category 2 using Lung-RADS\\nv1.1, or 4/248 (1.6%) of all GGNs. One of the reclassified GGNS proved to be malignant.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIn the updated LungRADS v1.1, a substantial proportion of patients with higher category nodules were reclassified downward to\\ncategory 2 (solid nodules-19.5%, GGN-80%) based on prevalence CT scans from the NLST. Only one reclassified nodule proved to\\nbe malignant.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThe use of the updated Lung-RADS v1.1 reclassifies downward a substantial percentage of nodules from category 3 and 4a to\\ncategory 2, which will lead to less frequent follow-up CT (at one year, equivalent to a negative low dose CT) and work-up.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSER02\\n\\nScience Session with Keynote: Emergency Radiology (Trauma - Head, Spine and Extremities)\\n\\nMonday, Nov. 30 2:00PM - 3:00PM Room: Channel 5\\n\\nCT\\n\\nER MK MR NR HN LM PR SQ\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .75\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSER02-01 Emergency Radiology Keynote Speaker: Role of Radiologist in Detecting Intimate Partner Violence\\n\\nParticipants\\nBharti Khurana, MD, Brookline, MA (Presenter) Research Consultant, General Electric CompanyEditor, Wolters Kluwer nvAuthor,\\nCambridge University Press\\n\\nSSER02-02 Recognizing Intimate Partner Violence: Defensive Ulnar Fractures\\n\\nParticipants\\nDavid Sing, MD, Boston, MA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nRahul B.

Radiographs were reviewed for fracture location, comminution, displacement, and associated injuries.\\nDemographic data, known IPV risk factors, and whether IPV screening was performed were also collected. Patients were stratified\\ninto four groups based on self-reporting and/or injury documentation as reported by EMS: confirmed IPV, suspected IPV, suspected\\nunrelated to IPV, and confirmed unrelated to IPV.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\n62 patients avg age 31±9 were identified (IPV: 11 confirmed, 9 suspected, 8 suspected unrelated, 34 confirmed unrelated). Patient\\nlanguage, race, ZIP code, wealth index, marital status, religion, alcohol/IV drug abuse, and psychiatric historywere not associated\\nwith IPV with or without suspected cases. Comparative analysis with and without suspected cases demonstrated IPV to be\\nassociated with minimally displaced fractures (95% vs 43%; p <0.001 and 91% vs 44%; p=0.012). Confirmed cases were also\\nassociated with homelessness (46% vs 0%; p<0.001), and number of documented ED visits attributable to musculoskeletal injury\\n(avg 4.4 ±3.7 vs 0.9 ±0.4; p<0.001). Formal documentation of IPV evaluation or screening was completed in only 40.0% of\\nconfirmed/suspected IPV patients and in 14.3% of confirmed/suspected unrelated to IPV patients.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nUp to one-third of adult women sustaining isolated ulnar fractures were potentially caused by IPV, yet screening for IPV was\\ninsituted in only 40% of suspected and confirmed cases. Radiologists should raise a suspicion of IPV especially with a non dispalced\\nisolated ulnar fracture.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nIsolated ulnar fracture in a woman, especially non displaced, should prompt the radiologist to raise a concern for IPV.\\n\\nSSER02-03 When Does a Facial Gunshot Wound Become Fatal?\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Fellow\\n\\nParticipants\\nMustafa B.

The electronic health record and\\nradiology reports were analyzed to understand the patterns and associations of injuries. Demographic data were also collected.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe cohort included 49 females and 6 males (19-63; mean age 38) with 22 white (40%), 20 African American (36%) and 13 other\\nrace (24%) individuals. At the time of the injury, IPV was documented as a mechanism of injury for only 14/88 injuries (16%) and\\nIPV screening was documented in only 22/88 injuries (25%).The hand was the most common site of injury and was involved in\\n34/55 (62%) patients and in 54/88 injuries (28 fractures, 5 dislocation/subluxation, 21 soft tissue injuries). Of 88 injuries, 50 were\\non the right side (57%). Phalangeal fractures constituted 46% of all UE fractures (21/46) with distal phalanx being the most\\ncommon (9/46). Among hand fractures, the 5th digit was the most commonly involved digit (8/28) followed by the 1st digit (7/28).\\nMedial hand fractures (5th, 4th digit) constituted 43% of hand fractures (12/28). 9 patients had concomitant injuries, with the\\nmost common being injuries of the head and neck region (8/9). Five patients had synchronous facial and hand injuries. 26 patients\\nhad a subsequent injury, of which the most common was another UE injury (12/26). Of the 12 patients with recurrent UE injuries, 7\\nhad recurrent hand injuries. Of these, the majority had at least one recurrent injury of the same side (6/7). 4 of 5 chronic injuries\\n(80%) were of the hand.\\n\\n\\x0cCONCLUSION\\n\\nHand injuries are the most common type of UE injuries in patients with IPV, with phalanx being the most common site of fracture\\nand medial hand the most common region of fracture. Repeated injuries involving the same site in the hand could represent IPV.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nAwareness of the characteristic patterns of UE injuries in IPV is essential for early identification of domestic abuse and to facilitate\\nappropriate timely intervention.\\n\\nSSER02-05 Imaging the Tight Orbit: Radiologic Manifestations of a Vision-threatening Emergency\\n\\nParticipants\\nChristoph Maier, MD, Berlin, Germany (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nJan O.

Patients are acutely at risk for optic nerve injury secondary to pressure damage or concomitant vascular\\ncompromise. Urgent surgical decompression is paramount to avoid vision loss. While patient management is usually guided by the\\nsyndrome of the \"tight orbit\" (firm globe, vision deficit and impaired ocular motility), clinical assessment may be limited in\\nunconscious, polytraumatized or pediatric patients. Therefore, we sought to evaluate radiological signs of the orbital compartment\\nsyndrome.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nCT images of consecutive patients with clinically proven orbital compartment syndrome from two academic level 1 trauma centers\\n(timeframe 2012-2017) were analyzed retrospectively. Proptosis, optic nerve length and posterior globe angle were manually\\nmeasured, each patient\\'s unaffected orbit served as an intra-individual control.To correct for globe displacement and motility\\ndisorders commonly seen in our patient collective, each measurement was obtained in a plane reformatted obliquely to the\\nrespective anatomy. Active bleeding was visually assessed.Data is reported as mean±SD and the paired t-test was used to test for\\nstatistical significance.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nA total of 26 patients were diagnosed with orbital compartment syndrome (10 male, 16 female, age 64,2±24,9). Most cases were\\ndue to traumatic hematoma and active bleeding was observed in 5 out of 11 patients examined with CECT. 24 patients underwent\\nurgent surgical decompression. CT imaging was available for quantification in 21 cases (no imaging: n=3; significant bilateral\\npathology: n=2). We observed marked proptosis and stretching of the optic nerve in the affected orbit (24.2±3.5 mm vs 17.4±3.3\\nmm and 31.6±3.1 vs 25.6±3.2, respectively; p < 0.01) as well as tenting of the posterior globe (posterior angle 123±17 vs 146±7 °;\\np < 0.01).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIn the largest patient collective reported to date, we show that the orbital compartment syndrome is characterized by marked\\nproptosis, stretching of the optic nerve and tenting of the posterior globe.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThe radiologic phentotype of the \\'tight orbit\\' enables radiologists to alert clinicians to this vision-threatening emergency, particularly\\nin patients where clinical assessment is limited.\\n\\nSSER02-06 Supplementary MRI for Exclusion of Ligamentous Injuries in Trauma Patients with Detected\\n\\nAsymmetry of the Lateral Atlanto-dental Interval on Initial CT Examination: A Diagnostic Benefit?\\n\\nParticipants\\nChristoph H.

We aimed to investigate the additional benefit of cervical spine MRI in trauma patients with LADI asymmetry\\nand lack of other proven cervical injuries.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\n\\x0cIn this retrospective study all trauma patients were included that have undergone a CSCT in the emergency room between 03/2017\\nand 08/2019. All patients with LADI asymmetry without other signs of cervical injury that underwent a supplementary cervical spine\\nMRI were identified. These MRI examinations were re-evaluated by experienced (with >8 years of experience in trauma imaging),\\nblinded readers regarding possible ligamentous injuries.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\n146 out of 1553 patients (9.4%) presented a LADI asymmetry on initial CT examination. Out of these, 46 patients without other\\nsigns of cervical injuries received an additional MRI with LADI asymmetry as the only indication. On initial examination, 9/46 patients\\n(19.6%) had cervical tenderness on palpation; 37/46 (80.4%) were asymptomatic. The mean LADI asymmetry was 2.54±1.33 mm.\\nBased on MRI, ligamentous injuries could be detected in only 2/46 (4.4%) patients; each with a LADI asymmetry >3mm and cervical\\ntenderness on palpation. Patients received treatment for ligamentous injury. Signal alterations of the alar ligaments without\\nruptures could be observed in 13/46 (28.3%) patients, leading to consequence of treatment regimen in 4 patients, although they\\nwere asymptomatic.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIn trauma patients with LADI asymmetry on CSCT, an additional MRI to exclude ligamentous injuries is only reasonable in\\nsymptomatic patients. The additional diagnostic value in clinically asymptomatic patients without any other proven cervical injuries\\nis low and possibly can lead to overtreatment. The results of this study may help to reduce the tremendous amount of additional\\nMRI examinations in ruling out CSI and to reduce unnecessary treatment and overall treatment costs.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nIn trauma patients sole LADI asymmetry can be due to normal variants, incorrect positioning and ligamentous injuries, which can\\nlead to diagnostic difficulties on initial CSCT. Additional MRI might only be indicated in symptomatic patients.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSGI03\\n\\nGastrointestinal (Artificial Intelligence Liver)\\n\\nMonday, Nov. 30 3:30PM - 4:30PM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nCT GI MR US OI AI\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .50\\n\\nFDA  Discussions may include off-label uses.\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSGI03-01 Establishing Volume Thresholds for Hepatomegaly at CT Using an Automated Artificial Intelligence\\n\\n(AI)-based Tool\\n\\nParticipants\\nVictoria Noe-Kim, MS, BS, Madison, WI (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nMeghan G.

Manual liver volumes and linear craniocaudal\\nmeasurement were also obtained from a subset of 189 patients. Additional demographic information (height/weight/BMI/BSA) was\\ncollected to identify factors that impact hepatic size.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nMean automated liver volume was 1500.2±337.5 ml in the pooled cohort, demonstrating a normal distribution. Therefore, the upper\\nlimit of normal (ULN) for hepatomegaly was set at two standard deviations above the mean (=2175.2 ml). For the 189 cases with\\nmanual comparison, the mean hepatic volume difference was 2.81%. Linear measures using a threshold of 20 cm tended to\\noverestimate hepatomegaly (based on volume definition), whereas a threshold of 22 cm tended to underestimate. Hepatic volume\\nwas significantly impacted by age, height, BMI, and BSA. A weighted equation showed weight as the dominant factor ((Liver Vol =\\n78.3(BSA) - 122.5(Height) + 413.3(Weight) - 203.8(BMI) - 106.2(Age) - 5.6(Gender)). A simple nomogram using 3 weight\\ncategories was created. For wt <= 82.55kg, ULN for post-contrast hepatic volume was 1728.5 ml; for wt between 82.55 and 100.1\\nkg, ULN was 2078.8 ml; and for wt >100.1 kg, ULN was 2748.1 ml. The impact of IV contrast administration on hepatic volume was\\nsmall (3.7%); no correction was felt needed.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nA novel AI-based method reliably measured hepatic volumes in a high-throughput, fully-automated manner, closely matching manual\\nmethods. Patient weight most strongly impacted liver volume, allowing for creation of a simple nomogram for determining volume-\\nbased thresholds for hepatomegaly.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nAssessment for hepatomegaly is difficult. Imaging-based diagnosis is not well established and currently utilizes unidimensional\\nmeasures. This AI tool allows for totally automated assessment of hepatic volume which taken in combination with the proposed\\nnomogram makes this more robust measure feasible for clinical practice.\\n\\nSSGI03-03 Automated Estimation of Sonographic Hepatorenal Index for Hepatic Steatosis Diagnosis\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Fellow\\n\\nParticipants\\nShuhang Wang, Boston, MA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nSzuyeu Hu, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nXiaohong Wang, MD, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nLei Chen, MD, Beijing, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJingchao Wang, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\n\\x0cMasoud Baikpour, MD, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nArinc Ozturk, MD, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nQian Li, MD, Malden, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nTheodore T.

For each patient, a B-mode\\nUS image of Morrison\\'s pouch view (MPV) containing liver and right kidney with minimal shadowing artifacts (SA) was selected. 57\\ncases were excluded due to unqualified MPV (n=36) or SA (n=21). 1258 qualified images were divided into training (n=1166) and\\ntest (n=92) sets. The test set included 47 patients without steatosis (S0) and 45 patients with steatosis (S1-S3). A radiologist\\nmanually annotated the liver and renal cortex as ground truth. A three-step method was developed to automatically estimate HRI.\\n1) The liver and renal cortex boundaries were segmented by a deep learning model trained on our dataset. 2) Invalid pixels were\\nexcluded by a custom rule-based algorithm identifying hepatorenal ducts, vessels, masses, and cysts. 3) Circular regions of interest\\n(ROI) were automatically placed in the densest area of valid renal cortical pixels and the nearby liver at the same depth. HRI is the\\nratio of liver to kidney mean ROI pixel value. For comparison, a radiologist manually estimated HRI. Receiver operating characteristic\\ncurves (ROCs) were plotted to compare manual and automated HRI prediction of histologic steatosis.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe manually/automatically calculated HRI (mean±std) was 0.99±0.28/1.01±0.33 for S0 and 1.24±0.36/1.49±0.87 for S1-S3. For\\nsteatosis diagnosis, the manual/auto-method obtained the best accuracy of 0.70/0.82 at the HRI threshold of 1.26/1.22. The areas\\nunder ROC for the physician and auto-method were 0.71 (95% CI: 0.60-0.80) and 0.81 (95% CI: 0.71-0.88), with significant\\ndifference (p=0.04).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nA custom algorithm capable of automatically calculating HRI was developed, which better predicts hepatic steatosis than manual\\nmeasurements. The algorithm can be easily translated into clinic care to optimize the diagnostic capability of US for hepatic\\nsteatosis.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nAutomated HRI calculation enables accurate, reproducible, and reliable diagnosis of hepatic steatosis to allow early intervention and\\nmanagement optimization of patients with fatty liver disease.\\n\\nSSGI03-04 End-to-end Liver Lesion Detection and Classification on Computed Tomography Scans Using Densely-\\n\\nconnected Convolution Network-based Deep Learning Model\\n\\nParticipants\\nWan Hang K.

Cross-\\nsectional imaging plays a crucial role in the detection and diagnosis of HCC although more than 40% of HCC demonstrate atypical\\nenhancement pattern resulting in additional investigations and delay in treatment. In recent years, convoluted neural networks\\n(CNN) has been successfully applied in many computer vision tasks including in radiological imaging and in this study, we applied the\\nstate-of-the-art CNN architecture in detecting and classifying liver lesions on computed tomography (CT) scans.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nMulti-phase abdominal CT of 899 patients were curated from 2 hospitals (571 and 328 scans with 842 and 658 lesions >1 cm\\nrespectively). Each lesion was manually contoured and labelled with ground-truths based on histology or clinical/radiological follow-\\nup. All lesions were also categorized based on LI-RADS classification, with diagnosis validated by a clinical composite reference\\nstandard based on patients\\' outcome over the subsequent 12 months. A densely-CNN consisting of five dense blocks, each\\ncontaining 64 convolutional layers, followed by a fully-connected layer with softmax as the activation function for classification.\\n(Figure 1a).\\n\\n\\x0cRESULTS\\n\\nThe mean age of the cohort was 63.5 years, 74.1% male. It was split into 7:3 as the training (629 cases) and testing (270 cases)\\nsets with the latter consisting of 75 (27.8%) HCC. After optimizing for over 115 million parameters, our model achieved 97%\\naccuracy, 92% PPV, 99% NPV, 97% sensitivity and 97% specificity on binary classification for HCC, compared to 86% accuracy,\\n87% PPV, 86% NPV, 85% sensitivity and 88% specificity for diagnosis via LI-RADS. Heat maps are also generated and superimposed\\non original images based on the model\\'s predictions of likelihood of the location of the lesions (Figure 1b).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nOur interim results have demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy of the densely-CNN in detecting and classifying liver lesions. Our\\nDeep Learning model has the potential to improve the diagnostic capabilities for HCC and prevent delays in treatment.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nDeep learning can be applied to accurately detect and evaluate focal liver lesions on Computed Tomography and has the potential\\nto improve the diagnostic capabilities for HCC, prevent delays in treatment and improve patient outcomes.\\n\\nSSGI03-05 Identification of Liver Cirrhosis on Standard T2-weighted MRI Images Using Deep Transfer Learning\\n\\nParticipants\\nNarine Mesropyan, Bonn, Germany (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nSebastian Nowak, Bonn, Germany (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nAnton Faron, MD, Bonn, Germany (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nMaike Theis, Bonn, Germany (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nWolfgang Block, Bonn, Germany (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nMartin Reuter, Bonn, Germany (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nUlrike I.

However, most of these findings are\\nsubjective, prone to interobserver variability, and overall, limited in sensitivity and specificity. We aimed to investigate the\\ncapabilities of a Deep Learning (DL) pipeline utilizing transfer learning to identify liver cirrhosis on standard T2-weighted (T2-w)\\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The diagnostic performance was compared against radiologists with different levels of\\nexperience.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThis retrospective clinical study included 713 (343 female) patients who underwent liver MRI between 2017-2019. Based on clinical\\nand histopathological parameters, 553 patients had cirrhosis of any stage. 160 patients did not have liver disease. For DL analysis,\\nradially acquired motion corrected T2-w MRI slices at the level of the lobus caudatus were exported. Data were randomly split into\\ntraining, validation and test sets (70%/15%/15%). The DL pipeline consisted of three steps: i) liver segmentation using a multi-\\nstream convolutional neural network (CNN); ii) post-processing, image cropping, interpolation and normalization; iii) image\\nclassification with the ResNet18 CNN pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, fine-tuned with the one cycle learning rate policy.\\nValidation and test data were also classified by two radiology residents (1st and 4th year) and a board certified radiologist with 8\\nyears of experience in abdominal imaging. Differences in accuracy of the DL based classification and the readers were assessed by\\nχ²-test.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nAccuracy of segmentation was 0.99 for validation (vACC) and test data (tACC). The accuracy of the DL based classification of\\ncirrhosis (vACC 0.96, tACC 0.95) was higher compared to the radiological residents\\' (1st year: vACC 0.68, p<0.01; tACC 0.72,\\np<0.01; 5th year: vACC 0.88, p<0.01; tACC 0.91, p<0.07) and equal or higher compared to the experienced radiologist\\'s (vACC\\n0.96; tACC 0.90, p<0.03).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe DL pipeline for image-based diagnosis of liver cirrhosis exhibited an expert-level classification and therefore could assist\\nradiologists in diagnosis of liver cirrhosis, leading to a higher accuracy of the reading performance.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nA Deep Learning pipeline using transfer learning can accurately identify liver cirrhosis on standard T2-w MR images.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSGI04\\n\\nScience Session with Keynote: Gastrointestinal (Artificial Intelligence General Applications)\\n\\nW ednesday, Dec. 2 8:30AM - 9:30AM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nCT GI MR OT OI BQ\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .75\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSGI04-01 Gastrointestinal Keynote Speaker: Practical Artificial Intelligence for the Abdominal Radiologist\\n\\nParticipants\\nAndrew D.

A proprietary low-contrast phantom consisting of low-\\ncontrast cylindrical objects was scanned at five dose index levels (1, 2, 3, 6, and 10 mGy) which were chosen to obtain images\\nwith noise levels comparable to the typical clinical images, given the phantom size. Image data sets from the human and phantom\\nwere reconstructed at section thickness of 2.5mm using three different reconstruction algorithms (FBP, ASiR-V 60%, DLIR with a\\nstrength level of medium). Subjective noise magnitude, noise texture, spatial resolution and diagnostic confidence of liver CT\\nimages were assessed. Next, twelve readers (five radiologists, seven medical physicists) assessed all data sets by measuring the\\ndetection accuracy using a two-alternative forced-choice perception approach( five contrast levels [range, 5-20 HU]and two sizes\\n[4,6 mm]). The dose reduction potential of DLIR was estimated using a generalized linear mixed-effects statistical model.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nCompared with FBP and ASiR-V 60%, DLIR medium showed lower noise magnitude, higher noise texture, and spatial resolution,\\nyielding better diagnostic confidence of liver CT images. Compared to FBP, both ASiR-V 60% and DLIR medium showed better lesion\\ndetection rate (improved by 4%, both P <.001) but identical between one another, which translated into an estimated radiation\\ndose reduction potential (±95% confidence interval) of 31±25%.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nDLIR medium increased detectability at a given radiation dose (approximately 4% increase in detection accuracy) allowing for\\nreducing the radiation dose of 31% ± 25 as compared to FBP, while improving readers\\' perception of overall image quality than FBP\\nand ASiR-V 60%.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThe use of the DLIR algorithm might maintain or improve the low-contrast detection performance at a low radiation dose level\\nwithout compromising the subjective abdominal image quality.\\n\\nSSGI04-03 Radiation Dose Reduction at Abdominal Ultra-high-resolution CT with Deep Learning Reconstruction\\n\\nParticipants\\nKeigo Narita, Hiroshima, Japan (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\n\\x0cYuko Nakamura, MD, Hiroshima, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nToru Higaki, PhD, Minami-ku, Hiroshima, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nMotonori Akagi, MD, Hiroshima, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nYukiko Honda, MD, Kure, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nKazuo Awai, MD, Hiroshima, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Research Grant, Canon Medical Systems Corporation; Research Grant,\\nHitachi, Ltd; Research Grant, Fujitsu Limited; Research Grant, Eisai Co, Ltd; Research Grant, Nemoto Kyorindo co., Ltd; Research\\nGrant, Fuji Pharma Co, Ltd; \\nMakoto Iida, Hiroshima, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nUltra-high-resolution computed tomography (U-HRCT) scanners yield images of increased spatial resolution although on smaller\\ndetectors, higher radiation doses are required for sufficient incident photons. Deep learning reconstruction (DLR) introduces deep\\nconvolutional neural networks trained on teaching datasets of higher-dose CT images reconstructed with model-based iterative\\nreconstruction (MBIR) into the reconstruction flow. In efforts to reduce the radiation dose we evaluated the effect of DLR on\\nabdominal U-HRCT images.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nWe evaluated 74 patients subjected to hepatic dynamic CT acquired by U-HRCT: 37 were scanned with standard- (group A) and 37\\nwith 70% of the standard dose (group B). Hepatic arterial- (HAP) and equilibrium phase (EP) images were reconstructed with\\nhybrid-IR, MBIR, and DLR. A radiologist recorded the standard deviation of attenuation in the paraspinal muscle as the image noise.\\nThe overall image quality was assessed by two other radiologists using a 5-point confidence scale ranging from 1 (unacceptable) to\\n5 (excellent). Non-inferiority was defined using a prespecified non-inferiority margin in which the upper limit of the 95% confidence\\ninterval (CI) did not exceed 2.0 for the image noise and in which the lower limit of the 95% CI was lower than -1 for the overall\\nimage quality.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nOn DLR- (95% CI: -0.97 - 1.71) but not on hybrid-IR- (95% CI: 2.32 - 5.60) and MBIR images (95% CI: -0.62 - 3.21), the criterion\\nfor the non-inferiority of the image noise in the HAP was met. In the EP, the image noise on DLR- and MBIR images of group B was\\nnot inferior to group A (95% CI: DLR, 0.59 - 1.86; MBIR, -1.13 - 1.85). However, on hybrid-IR images it was inferior in group B\\n(95% CI: 2.75 - 5.64). The quality score of DLR images acquired in the HAP of group B (95% CI: -0.74 - 0.18) and in the EP (95%\\nCI: -0.85 - 0.16) was not inferior to group A. However, on hybrid-IR- and MBIR images of the HAP it was inferior in group B (95%\\nCI: hybrid-IR, -1.47 - -0.44; MBIR, -1.82 - -0.60). The same was true for EP images (95% CI: hybrid-IR, -1.67 - -0.59; MBIR, -\\n3.32 - -1.03).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nDLR preserved the quality of abdominal U-HRCT images even when scanned with a reduced radiation dose.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nDLR yielded similar image quality of abdominal U-HRCT irrespective of the radiation dose, suggesting that DLR is essential for\\nradiation dose reduction in abdominal U-HRCT.\\n\\nSSGI04-04 Automated Segmentation and Worklist Prioritization of Pneumoperitoneum in Abdominal CT Images\\n\\nUsing a Convolutional Neural Network\\n\\nParticipants\\nRobert J. Harris, PhD, Eden Prairie, MN (Presenter) Employee, Virtual Radiologic Corporation\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nrobert.harris@vrad.com\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nPneumoperitoneum, the presence of free gas in the peritoneal cavity, can be a sign of critical pathology such as bowel perforation\\nor trauma. Pneumoperitoneum is often diagnosed with abdominal CT and early detection is important to a patient\\'s outcome. Our\\ninstitution processes approximately 3,300 abdominal CT studies per day, of which 1.3% are positive for pneumoperitoneum. We\\nhypothesized that a convolutional neural network could be trained to detect pneumoperitoneum in prospective patients in order to\\nexpedite patient care.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nNatural language processing (NLP) of radiology CT reports was used retrospectively to identify 297 body CT studies containing\\npneumoperitoneum. Axial CT images of these studies were annotated by a Board Certified radiologist to train a convolutional neural\\nnetwork. The training dataset consisted of 2,986 positive images and their segmentations, along with an equal number of negative\\nimages. A uNet model was trained using ResNet32 as the backbone. The model was first applied to a test cohort of 100 patients.\\nThis model was then integrated with our teleradiology pipeline to screen prospective patients for pneumoperitoneum in real-time,\\nwith NLP of the subsequent radiology report used as ground truth.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe model achieved an AUC of 0.906 on the test dataset. A detection threshold of 3 cc pneumoperitoneum was selected. Over a\\ntwo-week period, for prospective patients, the model had a sensitivity of 50.1% and a specificity of 94.7%. The mean volume of\\npneumoperitoneum was 37.4 cc for true positives with a maximum of 413.5 cc.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nAn artificial intelligence model was trained to quantify pneumoperitoneum on CT images and implemented in a real-time clinical\\nsystem. To our knowledge, this is the first use of machine learning to identify pneumoperitoneum on CT images and perform worklist\\nprioritization for patients based on its presence. This model is currently being expanded to identify additional types of free air such\\nas pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, and soft tissue gas.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\n\\x0cPneumoperitoneum is often an indicator of critical pathology and an artificial intelligence model can provide real-time detection of\\nthis condition on CT to save patients valuable time between scanning and treatment.\\n\\nSSGI04-05 Mri-Based Radiomics Nomogram to Predict Synchronous Liver Metastasis in Primary Rectal Cancer\\n\\nPatients\\n\\nParticipants\\nFu Shen, Shanghai, China (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nMinglu Liu, Shanghai, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJianping Lu, MD, Shanghai, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nYuwei Xia, MEd,MEd, Beijing, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nssff_53@163.com\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo investigate the value of MRI-based radiomics nomogram in prediction of synchronous liver metastasis (SLM) in patients with\\nprimary rectal cancer.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nA total of 127 patients with rectal cancer were enrolled and underwent rectal MRI in our hospital on a 3T scanner. Radiomics\\nfeatures were extracted from oblique axial high resolution T2WI images of the entire primary tumor. Computer-generated random\\nnumbers were used to assign 80% of the VOIs to the training set and 20% of VOIs to the validation set. The optimal features were\\nselected by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method and to construct the radiomics signature. Univariate\\nlogistic regression was used to select for independent clinical risk factors and multivariate logistic regression with radiomics\\nsignature were used to construct predictive model and nomogram. The prediction performance of the nomogram was evaluated by\\nreceiver operating characteristic (ROC) and the decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to judge the net benefit for a range of\\nthreshold probabilities to estimate whether the nomogram was sufficiently robust for clinical use.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nOf the 127 patients, 32 patients (25.20%) were accompanied by SLM. 1409 quantitative imaging features were extracted from MR\\nimages, and 5 optimal features were selected by LASSO algorithm (Fig. 1). CEA and CA19-9 were included in the multifactor logistic\\nregression to construct predictive model and nomogram (Fig. 2). The radiomics nomogram combined with clinical risk factors showed\\na good predictive performance in the validation set (Fig. 3), the AUC, specificity and sensitivity were 0.944 (95% CI: 0.895 -\\n0.993), 88.90% and 95.83%, which was higher than that the radiomics model with an AUC of 0.866 (P=0.044). The DCA for the\\nradiomics nomogram was displayed in Fig. 4. It showed relatively good performance for radiomics nomogram model in predicting SLM.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe radiomics nomogram combining the radiomics signature and clinical factors can serve as a quantitative tool to predict\\nsynchronous liver metastasis of rectal cancer.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nOur study indicated that radiomics nomogram based on primary rectal cancer could provide a non-invasive way to predict the risk\\nof SLM in clinical practice.\\n\\nSSGI04-06 Prediction of Major Cardiovascular Events in a Large Outpatient Adult Cohort Using Fully Automated\\n\\nand Normalized Deep Learning Body Composition Analysis of Routine Abdominal CT\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Fellow\\n\\nParticipants\\nKirti Magudia, MD,PhD, San Francisco, CA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nChristopher Bridge, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Institutional support, NVIDIA CorporationInstitutional support, General Electric\\nCompanyInstitutional support, Nuance Communications, Inc\\nCamden P.

We hypothesize that fully automated BC analysis\\ncan augment traditional CV risk models in a large outpatient cohort.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\n33,182 outpatient abdominal CT exams performed in our hospital system in 2012 for 23,126 patients were identified. 12,128 patients\\nwere free of major CV or cancer diagnoses at time of imaging and their earliest abdominal CT exam in 2012 was selected and\\nanalyzed by a deep learning pipeline to determine BC metrics: skeletal muscle area, visceral fat area (VFA) and subcutaneous fat\\n\\n\\x0carea (Fig A, B). Reference curves were generated through a modified LMS method and used to calculate normalized z-scores.\\nCause-specific Cox proportional hazards models corrected for height, weight, BMI, institution, smoking status, diabetes and systolic\\nblood pressure (SBP) were used to predict the risk of future myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke based on BC z-scores.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe cohort (mean age, 52 years; 57% women; 83% White, 9% Black, 3% Asian) was followed for 5 years following each person\\'s\\nindex abdominal CT exam. 1560 MI and 938 stroke events occurred. Visceral fat area (VFA) was independently associated with\\nfuture MI (hazard ratio [HR] with 95%CI: 1.15 [0.95-1.41], 1.05 [0.84-1.31], and 1.31 [1.03-1.67] for quartiles 2, 3, and 4 versus\\nthe first quartile, p=0.04), while no evidence of an association was present for weight and height (Fig C). VFA was also\\nindependently associated with future stroke (HR: 1.37 [1.05-1.77], 1.49 [1.13-1.97], and 1.46 [1.07-2.00] for quartiles 2, 3, and 4\\nversus the first quartile, p=0.04), while no evidence of an association was present for weight and height (Fig D).

Two abdominal radiologists independently evaluated EMVI and DEMI on preoperative CT,\\nblinded to pathology. We assessed the association of age, sex, EMVI, and DEMI to synchronous metastasis on preoperative CT,\\nusing the Fisher\\'s exact test for univariable analysis and logistic regression for multivariable analysis. Continuous variables were\\ndichotomized (older vs. younger than mean age; DEMI > 5 mm vs. 5 mm or less). We used the log-rank tests to compare disease-\\nfree survival (DFS) with and without the variables (age, sex, EMVI, DEMI, synchronous metastasis, and lymph node metastasis on\\npathology). We used the Cox\\'s proportional hazards models to identify variables significantly associated with recurrence. We\\nassessed interobserver agreement using kappa.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nWe included 189 patients (81 men; mean [standard deviation] age, 65.4 [13.0] years), 21 of whom had synchronous metastases on\\npreoperative CT. 29 patients showed EMVI, and 78 showed more than 5-mm DEMI. On multivariable analysis, DEMI > 5 mm was\\nassociated with synchronous metastasis (odds ratio, 27.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.8-82.1; P < .001). In DFS analysis, we\\nincluded 166 patients (66 men; 65.2 [12.9] years), excluding those who underwent non-curative surgeries (R1 or R2) or were lost\\nfollow-up. Median follow-up duration was 47 months (interquartile range, 29-60 months). Recurrence was observed in 34 patients\\n(20%) during at least 12-month follow-up. Variables associated with worse DFS were EMVI (hazard ratio[HR], 3.6; 95% CI, 1.4-9.2;\\nP = .001), DEMI > 5 mm (HR, 3.8; 95% CI, 1.7-8.5; P = .008), and lymph node metastasis on pathology (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1-6.7;\\nP = .03). Interobserver agreements were good (EMVI, 0.67, 95% CI, 0.50-0.83; DEMI, 0.64, 95% CI, 0.48-0.80).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nEMVI and DEMI > 5 mm on preoperative CT are associated with worse prognosis of T3 ascending colon cancer.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThis study showed the prognostic impact of EMVI and DEMI in patients with T3 ascending colon cancer. Thus, these CT findings\\ncould be used as imaging biomarkers for the stratification of patients with T3 ascending colon cancer.\\n\\nSSGI06-02 Quantitative Evaluation from Spectral Detector CT in Regional Lymph Node Metastasis of Colorectal\\n\\nCancer\\n\\nParticipants\\nYan Chen, Guangzhou, China (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nYuru Ma, MD,MD, Guangzhou, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nYiyan Liu, Guangzhou, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nZiqiang Wen, Guangzhou, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nXinyue Yang, Guangzhou, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nXiaojuan Xiao, BMedSc, MMedSc, Guangzhou, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nBao Lan Lu, Guangzhou, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nShen Ping Yu, Guangzhou, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\ncheny866@mail.sysu.edu.cn\\n\\n\\x0cPURPOSE\\n\\nTo investigate the value of quantitative parameters derived from spectral detector computed tomography (SDCT) in the diagnosis\\nof regional metastatic lymph nodes (LNs) of colorectal cancer.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThe venous phase contrast enhanced SDCT images of 84 patients with colorectal cancer were analyzed. The short-axis diameter\\n(S) of the largest regional LN was measured, and the border and the enhancement homogeneity of the LN were evaluated. The\\niodine density (ID), effective atomic number (Zeff), normalized iodine density (NID) and normalized effective atomic number (NZeff)\\nof the whole volume of the LN were measured. These parameters were compared between pathologically metastatic and\\nnonmetastatic LNs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to evaluate diagnostic performance for these\\nparameters.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nA total of 84 LNs were included, with 31 metastatic LNs. The S, border, enhancement homogeneity, ID, Zeff, NID and NZeff of LNs\\nin venous phase contrast enhanced images all showed significant differences between the metastatic and nonmetastatic LNs (each\\nP < 0.001). ID was the best parameter for differentiating metastatic and nonmetastatic LNs, the area under the curve (AUC) was\\n0.946. With a threshold of 1.56 mg/mL of ID, the sensitivity and specificity were 87.10% and 88.68%, respectively. The diagnostic\\nvalue was higher than that of S (AUC = 0.830, P < 0.05), border (AUC = 0.659, P < 0.001) and enhancement homogeneity (AUC =\\n0.734, P < 0.001) of LNs. Interobserver reproducibility was excellent for ID, Zeff, NID and NZeff of LNs measurements (intraclass\\ncorrelation coefficient = 0.977-0.986).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nSDCT quantitative parameters facilitate the accurate diagnosis of regional metastatic LNs in patients with colorectal cancer, among\\nwhich, ID has the highest diagnostic efficiency in differentiating metastatic and nonmetastatic LNs.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nSDCT quantitative parameters provide an effective noninvasive method for accurate evaluation of regional metastatic LNs in\\npatients with colorectal cancer.\\n\\nSSGI06-03 MRI-based Tumor Regression Analysis after Short-course and Long-course Neoadjuvant (Chemo)\\n\\nRadiotherapy in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer\\n\\nParticipants\\nArya Haj-Mirzaian, MD,MPH, Baltimore, MD (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nBashar Safar, MD, Baltimore, MD (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJeffrey Meyer, Durham, NC (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nAmol Narang, MD, Baltimore, MD (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nNilofer Azad, Baltimore, MD (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nAdrian Murphy, Baltimore, MD (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nChady Atallah, MD, Baltimore, MD (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nLysandra Voltaggio, Baltimore, MD (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nRebecca Sahyoun, Baltimore, MD (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nAtif Zaheer, MD, Baltimore, MD (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nahajmir1@jhmi.edu\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo assess the diagnostic value of restaging MRI after short- and long-course neoadjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy in patients with\\nlocally advanced rectal cancer. We also aimed to compare the radiologic response between these two neoadjuvant\\n(chemo)radiotherapy regimens.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThis HIPAA-compliant study was approved by IRB. Medical records of patients diagnosed with stage II/III (T3/4, any N, M0) rectal\\ncancer who received short- or long-course neoadjuvant (chemo)radiotherapy were reviewed. Short-course radiotherapy was\\ndefined as 25Gy given over a week before surgery. Long-course (chemo)radiotherapy was defined as 50.4-54Gy given over 5-6\\nweeks before surgery. MRI-based tumor regression grade (mrTRG), mrTNM stage, and other imaging features were assessed by a\\nradiologist using pre- and post-treatment T2-weighted and DWI MRIs. Pathological findings were reviewed for the post-treatment\\npTNM stage. Level of agreement between restaging MRI findings and pathological results were evaluated using weighted k analysis.\\nAssociation between regimens (short- vs. long-course) and radiologic/pathologic findings was assessed using regression analysis.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nA total of 44 patients were included (short-course=22, long-course=22; matched for age, gender, pre-treatment mrTNM stage).\\nThe overall inter-test agreement (κ value) of 0.3-0.8 was observed between restaging mrTNM/mrTRG and pTNM. Analyses showed\\na significantly higher level of agreement between radiologic and pathologic findings in short-course group (κ=0.81) when compared\\nwith long-course group (κ=0.32) (P=0.002). Short-course radiotherapy was associated with a better mrTRG (OR(95%CI): 3.75(1.1-\\n13.1)) and mrTNM (OR(95%CI): 4.39(0.9-19.4)) complete response when compared with long-course (chemo)radiotherapy.\\nHowever, no significant association between neoadjuvant regimens and pTNM complete response and ΔADC was detected (P>0.05).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIn patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, restaging MRI is more valid after short-course radiotherapy in comparison with\\nlong-course regimen. Furthermore, short-course neoadjuvant radiotherapy may lead to a better or equal radiologic tumor response\\nwhen compared with long-course (chemo)radiotherapy.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nMRI-based tumor regression analysis of rectal cancer is more accurate after short-course neoadjuvant radiotherapy (vs. long-\\n\\n\\x0ccourse). Short-course radiotherapy is also associated with a better radiologic response.\\n\\nSSGI06-04 Magnetic Resonance Imaging Tumor Response Score (mrTRS) Predicts Therapeutic Effect and\\n\\nPrognosis of Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer After Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy: A Prospective,\\nMulti-Center Study\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Medical Student\\n\\nParticipants\\nZhen Guan, Beijing, China (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nYing-shi Sun, MD,PhD, Beijing, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\n18801231091@163.com\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nThe mrTRG is limited by its subjectivity and poor consistency with pathological tumor regression grade (pTRG). We proposed to\\nestablish a new MRI criterion to predict pTRG of LARC which can accurately predict prognosis.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThe established new MRI criterion (mrTRS) was based on the retrospective sample of 214 LARC patients. Subsequently, a\\nprospective, multicenter of 878 LARC patients were enrolled. Baseline and post-operative MRI were obtained, imaging features\\nincluding mrTRS, mrTRG, T staging, N staging, extramural venous invasion (EMVI), mesorectal fascia(MRF) were measured with\\npathological, clinical and follow-up data collection. The primary outcome was to prove mrTRS an independent predictor for\\nprognosis in LARC patients with NACRT by Kaplan-meier method with log-rank estimate and multivariate cox regression model. The\\nsecond outcome was to compare the predictive capability for 3-year prognosis between mrTRS and mrTRG by time-dependent ROC\\ncurves.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nMultivariate analysis indicated that mrTRS was an independent predictor of survival outcomes. mrTRS stratified good and moderate\\nresponders presented significantly lower risk for death compare with poor responders(HR=0.04, 95%CI 0.01-0.31; HR=0.35, 95%CI\\n0.23-0.52), distant metastasis(HR=0.25, 95%CI 0.13-0.52; HR=0.42, 95%CI 0.30-0.58), and local recurrence(HR=0.01 95%CI 0.23-\\n0.52;HR=0.38, 95%CI 0.16-0.90). Contrastly, there was no significant difference in survival outcomes among mrTRG stratified\\ngroups. Excellent and substantial interobserver agreement for mrTRS and mrTRG evaluation (κ=0.92 and 0.62), respectively.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe established mrTRS can serve as an effective predictor for assessing tumor regression grade in LARC with neoadjuvant\\nchemoradiotherapy.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nWe recommend the evaluation of mrTRS in clinical practice.\\n\\nSSGI06-05 Tumor Heterogeneity in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer Treated with Neoadjuvant Chemoradiation:\\n\\nCan It Predict Pathological Complete Response?\\n\\nParticipants\\nToru Tochigi, MD, Boston, MA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nSophia C.

No reliable modality\\nthat can predict the efficacy of nCRT and relapse.The purpose of this study is to measure tumor heterogeneity in patients with\\nLARC using CT based fractal and filtration-histogram analysis, and to assess their influence on the efficacy of nCRT.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nIn this retrospective study, 215 patients [57 years (18-87 years)] who received nCRT for LARC between June 2005 to December\\n2016 and underwent a staging diagnostic portal venous phase CT were identified. The patients were randomly divided into two\\ndatasets: a training set (n = 170), and a validation set (n = 45). Tumor heterogeneity was assessed on the CT images using fractal\\ndimension (FD) and filtration-histogram analysis. In training set, the patients with pCR and non-pCR were compared in univariable\\nanalysis. Logistic regression analysis was applied to identify the predictive value of efficacy of nCRT and receiver operating\\ncharacteristic analysis determined cut-off value. Subsequently, we assessed that parameter in validation set.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nOut of the 215 patients were evaluated. pCR was reached in 20.9% (n = 45/215) patients. In the training set, 7 out of 37 textural\\nparameters showed significant difference comparing between the pCR and non-pCR groups and logistic multivariable regression\\nanalysis incorporating clinical and 7 textural parameters showed that only FD was associated with pCR (P = 0.001). The area under\\nthe curve of FD was 0.76. In the validation set, we applied FD for predicting pCR and sensitivity, specificity and accuracy was\\n\\n\\x0c60%, 89% and 82%, respectively.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nFractal Dimension on pretreatment CT is a promising parameter for predicting pathological complete response to neo-adjuvant\\nchemoradiation in patients with LARC and could be used to help make treatment decisions.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nCT based depiction of tumor heterogeneity is a highly promising imaging biomarker and may potentially select patients for\\nindividualized therapy.\\n\\nSSGI06-06 A Large-Scale Temporal Validation of the MRI Radiomics Model for Prediction of Pathological\\nComplete Response After Preoperative Chemoradiotherapy in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer\\n\\nParticipants\\nSungwon Kim, MD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJaeseung Shin, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nHeejin Bae, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nNak-Hoon Son, PhD, Yongin, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJoonseok Lim, MD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\ndinbe@yuhs.ac\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo evaluate radiomics model using T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a potential biomarker for predicting\\npathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy-radiation therapy (CRT) in patients with rectal cancer,\\ncompared with qualitative assessment by radiologists.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThis retrospective study included consecutive 898 patients with locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma (>=cT3 or N+) who\\nunderwent MRI and subsequent total mesorectal excision after CRT between January 2009 and December 2018. The patients were\\ndivided into training cohort (n = 592) and temporally independent validation cohort (n = 306). Surgical histopathologic analysis was\\nthe reference standard for pCR. Radiomics features were extracted from the volume of interest on T2-weighted images and a\\nradiomics signature was generated using least absolute shrinkage and a selection operator with ten-fold cross-validation. Three\\nexperienced abdominal radiologists independently rated tumor regression grade and compared the diagnostic outcome of the\\nradiomics model.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nAmong 898 patients, 189 patients (21%) achieved pCR. The radiomics model demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.82 (95%\\nconfidence interval [CI]: 0.76, 0.87) in the temporal validation cohort, which is significantly higher than the AUCs of the three\\nreaders (0.73, 0.74, 0.73) and the pooled AUC (0.74, P=0.009). In the binary classification using the best cutoff derived from the\\ntraining cohort, radiomics model showed sensitivity of 80% (95% CI: 0.71, 0.89) and specificity of 68% (95% CI: 0.62, 0.74).

The vials were scanned with dual-layer spectral CT (Philips IQon) at 120 kVp and 140 kVp using an anthropomorphic\\nabdominal phantom and cylindrical water-filled insert. Three different phantom habitus were evaluated, with the cylindrical insert\\nrotated to 0, 120, and 240 degrees for each habitus (126 scans total). Circular ROI of 1.1 cm^2 were placed inside each vial on\\nthree consecutive slices and the Hounsfield, Compton, and photoelectric mean values were used for analysis (2,646 ROI total). This\\nprocedure was repeated at 120 kVp with all seven high-Z elements at six isoattenuating values from 250 to 8 HU (54 scans and\\n1,296 ROI total). Compton versus photoelectric mean value plots were used for analysis. Quantification accuracy was measured by\\nusing a linear regression model and residual error analysis with 90% limits of agreement. Pairwise differentiation of isoattenuating\\nvials was evaluated using the mean AUC values and the difference in fit angle between the two elements.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nEach high-Z element had a unique concentration vector in a 2D histogram of Compton versus photoelectric attenuation.\\nConcentration mean values were within +/- 0.1 mg/mL of the true values for each element vial and kVp with no proportional error in\\nthe 90% limits of agreement (less than +/- 0.4 mg/mL for each vial). Pairwise differentiation of isoattenuating vials was proportional\\nto the Hounsfield unit and the angle of separation between the linear fits with mean AUC values of 0.61, 0.78, 0.85, 0.91, 0.95, and\\n0.98 at 6, 16, 31, 63, 125, and 250 HU, respectively.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nDual-layer spectral CT can differentiate and quantify isoattenuating high-Z elements, with the differentiation accuracy being\\ndirectly proportional to the elemental concentration and the angle of separation in a two-dimensional histogram of Compton and\\nphotoelectric attenuation.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThe high-attenuation and unique concentration vectors of Yb, Ta, Au, and Bi are well suited for new clinical dual-energy CT\\ncontrast agents, especially when simultaneously imaged with I, Ba, or Gd.\\n\\nSSGI07-02 Reproducibility of Dual-energy CT Derived Radiomic Features Across Different Dual-energy CT\\n\\nScanner Types\\n\\nParticipants\\nSimon Lennartz, MD , Cologne, MA (Presenter) Institutional research support, Koninklijke Philips NV\\nAileen O\\'Shea, FFR(RCSI),MBBCh, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nAnushri Parakh, MBBS, MD, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nAvinash R.

Our aim was to investigate the reproducibility of radiomic\\nfeatures in patients who underwent repeated abdominal CTs on three different dual-energy CT (DECT) scanner types.\\n\\n\\x0cMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\n30 patients were included in this retrospective, IRB-approved study. Each patient had between two and three contrast-enhanced\\nabdominal DECTs, with the same protocol, on at least two of three dual energy scanner types: dual-source, rapid kV switching and\\ndual-layer detector. Radiomic features were obtained, following single slice placement of four individual, fixed-diameter (10mm)\\nregions-of-interest (ROIs) in hepatic segments II and VI, and the upper and lower poles of the spleen. ROIs were placed on virtual\\nmonoenergetic images at 65 keV (VMI65keV) and virtual unenhanced images (VUE) in a side-by-side setup, permitting consistent\\nROI placement. Liver and splenic parenchyma with non-physiological appearance (e.g. metastatic involvement) was excluded to\\navoid confounding (e.g. due to therapy response or disease progression). 92 radiomic features were extracted from each ROI.\\nIntra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated in order to determine inter-scanner reproducibility for individual radiomics\\nfeatures.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\n7 features derived from VUE and 10 features derived from VMI65keV yielded a good reproducibility (ICC > 0.6). The three most\\nrobust VUE-derived features were gray level matrix features: low gray level emphasis, joint average and sum average (ICC of\\nall=0.65), whereas the three most robust VMI65keV features were the first order features median, mean and 10th percentile\\n(ICC=0.70, 0.71, 0.72). A large proportion of features in both reconstructions (VMI65keV: 83.2%, VUE: 86.4%) showed a poor\\nreproducibility across vendors (ICC <0.4).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nOur initial data suggest a limited reproducibility of radiomics features across the three most frequently used dual-energy CT scanner\\ntypes. Iodine enhancement seems to impact reproducibility of higher-level feature classes, while first order features were rather\\nrobust in contrast-enhanced images.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nData on reproducibility of radiomic features across different scanners is crucial to facilitate clinical application of diagnostic\\napproaches based on radiomics.\\n\\nSSGI07-05 Quantification of the Liver-Fat Content Using Dual-energy CT Multimaterial Decomposition (MMD)\\n\\nAlgorithm: Comparison with Tissue Reference Standards and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Derived\\nProton Density Fat Fraction (MRI-PDFF) in an Animal Study\\n\\nParticipants\\nTingting Xie JR, MD, Shenzhen, China (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nYing Guo, Guangzhou, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJingyu Zhou, MS, BS, Shenzhen, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nGuanxun Cheng, Shenzhen, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nttxietinarsna@163.com\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo compare the difference of DECT MMD algorithm and MRI-PDFF for hepatic fat fraction quantification.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nA total of 12 rats were divided into the normal group, moderate and severe hepatic steaotosis group (3,6,3 rats relatively)\\naccording to TG mass-fraction of 4.43%, 14.03%and 27.83%(the quantifications of TG were acquired by using a colorimetric assay\\n). The rats were scanned by GE Revolution CT scanner using GSI mode first, then were scanned by MRI using Philips Ingenia 3.0T\\nmagnetic resonance system with mDixcon-quant sequence and eight channel animal coil. After the CT scan, reconstructed imaging\\ndata were processed by using MMD soft-ware currently not commercially available. MMD-derrived fat volume fraction (MMD-FVF)\\nand PDFF-based fat fraction (PDFF) were measured. Reference values of FVF were determined by the quantification of Triglyceride\\n(TG) mass-fraction using a colorimetric assay. A linear regression was performed to analyze the relationship between the measured\\nfat fractions and the actual TG fraction.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe TG mass-fraction of this study can be used to simulate the fat content of normal to severe hepatic steatosis in human liver.\\nBoth algorithms showed good linear relationship between the measured fat fraction and actual TG fraction.

For PDFF, the linear correlation equation was y=0.924x-\\n2.025(r² = 0.973, P=0.000).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nBoth of DECT FVF acquired by using MMD algorithm and MRI-PDFF acquired by using mDixcon-quant sequence were demonstrated\\nto provide accurate and reliable measurement of fat fraction for animal model, which will has the potential to be used in clinical\\ntrials for hepatic fat quantification.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThis study demonstrated that dual-energy CT MMD algorithm may has the potential to provide an opportunity to screen for hepatic\\nsteatosis in NAFLD patients undergoing scan for unrelated reasons. The advantages include high accuracy with no additional\\nscanning required, fast acquisition, ease of performance, which makes it attractive to be applied in future clinical trials.\\n\\nSSGI07-06 Longitudinal Reproducibility of Dual-Energy CT Derived Iodine Quantification: An In-Patient, Inter-\\n\\nScanner Comparison\\n\\nParticipants\\nSimon Lennartz, MD , Cologne, MA (Presenter) Institutional research support, Koninklijke Philips NV\\nAnushri Parakh, MBBS, MD, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJinjin Cao, MD, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\n\\x0cNils Grosse Hokamp, MD, Koln, Germany (Abstract Co-Author) Research Grant, Koninklijke Philips NVSpeakers Bureau, Koninklijke\\nPhilips NV\\nAvinash R.

Our aim was to investigate reproducibility of iodine measurements in\\npatients who underwent two repetitive DECT examinations either on a dual-source (dsDECT), a rapid kV switching (rsDECT) or a\\ndual-layer detector scanner (dlDECT).\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nWe retrospectively included 133 patients who underwent two repetitive, portal-venous phase abdominal DECT examinations. 48\\npatients were repetitively scanned on dsDECT, 45 on rsDECT and 41 on dlDECT. The groups were matched for body weight, age,\\nsex and average inter-scan differences in contrast media and saline chaser amount as well as flow rate. Three readers measured\\niodine concentration in iodine maps and HU in virtual monoenergetic images (VMI) at 65 keV as grey-scale reference; regions of\\ninterest (ROIs) were placed in the left/right liver lobe, upper/lower spleen, left/right renal cortex, abdominal aorta and portal vein.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nAveraged over all ROIs, absolute difference in iodine between two repetitive scans was 0.60±0.63, 0.78±0.83 and 0.85±0.83 mg/ml\\nfor rsDECT, dlDECT and dsDECT, respectively; the corresponding HU differences in VMI65keV were 18.0±19.0, 24.1±26.6, 20.1±32.8\\nHU. Median relative variation between repetitive scans regarding the kidneys was comparable between rsDECT (9.1 (3.6-15.4)%),\\ndlDECT (10.3 (4.4-20.4)%) and dsDECT 10.9 (5.6-37.4) %). For liver and spleen, differences were more pronounced (rsDECT:10.6\\n(5.1-18.7) %, dlDECT: 14.8 (6.9-31.0)%, dsDECT:0.23 (9.9-59.0)%. Normalizing the iodine uptake of the liver/spleen to the portal\\nvein/aorta did not reduce longitudinal variability in any of the included scanners (p-range: 0.49-0.55).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIodine quantification in DECT is subject to intra-individual, longitudinal variability which should be acknowledged when aiming to use\\nit for oncologic imaging. Longitudinal variability may vary between scanner types when quantifying iodine in the liver and the spleen.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nOur study provides evidence on longitudinal consistency of iodine measurements, comparing frequently used DECT scanner types.\\nThis facilitates clinical application, e.g. at oncologic response assessment.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSGI08\\n\\nGastrointestinal (Dual Energy CT Diagnosis)\\n\\nSaturday, Dec. 5 5:00PM - 6:00PM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nCT GI OT OI BQ\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .50\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSGI08-01 Use of Dual-energy CT for Prediction of Response to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapies\\n\\nParticipants\\nCarolyn L.

All patients underwent contrast-enhanced DECT exams\\nat baseline (BL) and after initiation of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. At least one exam after treatment initiation (FU1) was\\navailable. Target lesions were selected and assessed based on RECIST 1.1 criteria for BL, FU1 and final follow-up (FFU), defined as\\nthe most recent exam while on therapy. DECT-based iodine concentration values were obtained for all target lesions and\\nsubsequently normalized to iodine in the abdominal aorta (NIC). Tumor percent changes in NIC between BL and FU1 were\\ncalculated. Lesions were categorized at FFU as progressive disease (PD), stable disease (SD) or partial response (PR). Analysis of\\nvariance was used to assess differences in NIC between lesions based on response category. Ordinal logistic regression of percent\\nchange in NIC at FU1 on status at FFU was performed. Cut-off values for NIC were determined from the model parameter estimates\\nand used to assess NIC performance on FU1 using RECIST 1.1 status at FFU as the standard.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThirty-one lesions were assessed at BL and FU1 with an average of 141 days between scans. At FU1, mean NIC increased 34% in\\nPD lesions compared to -38% for PR and -18% for SD (p=0.032). Twenty-four lesions were assessed at FFU with an average of 236\\ndays after BL. NIC at FU1 was predictive of response at FFU (p=0.014). Cut-off values were defined as +65.9% change in NIC for\\nnon-responders and -10.2% change for responders. NIC at FU1 predicted 23/24 responding lesions at FFU and misclassified 1 lesion\\nas PD, while use of RECIST 1.1 criteria at FUI predicted 22/24 responders but misclassified 2 lesions as PD.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIn patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, early changes in DECT iodine concentration may allow for prediction of lesion\\nresponse with increasing NIC predicting future progression and decreasing NIC predicting future response.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nEarly changes in DECT lesion iodine concentration may be useful in predicting treatment response in patients on immune checkpoint\\ninhibitor therapies.\\n\\nSSGI08-02 Dual Energy CT of the Liver: True Non-contrast versus Virtual Non-contrast Image Derived from\\n\\nMultiple Phases to Predict Hepatic Steatosis\\n\\nParticipants\\nMoon Hyung Choi, MD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nYoung Joon Lee, MD,PhD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nchoimh1205@gmail.com\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo compare the difference in liver density on the true non-contrast image (TNC) and three virtual non-contrast images (VNCs)\\nderived from the arterial, portal and delayed phases of dual-energy CT (DECT) of the liver and to evaluate a correlation between\\nliver density on four non-contrast images (NCs) and the degree of hepatic steatosis measured on liver MRI\\n\\n\\x0cMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nAmong patients who underwent DECT of the liver using the third-generation DECT in 2019, 75 patients who underwent liver MRI\\nwithin 100 days of liver CT were included in this study. The gold standard of hepatic steatosis was determined by the multi-echo\\nDixon technique of liver MRI. A board-certificated radiologist drew multiple regions-of-interest (ROIs) in the liver (left lateral, right\\nposterior, and right anterior sections) avoiding large vessels and masses on TNC and VNCs from arterial (VNCa), portal (VNCp), and\\ndelayed (VNCd) phases. Three ROIs in the liver were compared to each other on each image using paired t-tests with Bonferroni\\ncorrection. Mean liver densities among four NCs were compared using paired t-tests. Correlation between mean liver density on\\neach NC and the degree of hepatic steatosis was analyzed using a Pearson correlation test.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe average degree of hepatic steatosis in the patients was 3.8 %. Liver densities in three ROIs were not different on four NCs (P\\n> 0.05). In the left lateral and right anterior hepatic sections, liver density was significantly lower on all VNCs than TNC (P<0.001).\\nIn the right posterior hepatic section, liver density on VNCd was significantly lower than TNC (P<0.001) and liver density did not\\ndiffer from each other in other pairwise comparisons. Liver densities in three ROIs on TNC showed a significant correlation to the\\ndegree of hepatic steatosis but liver densities in all ROIs on three VNCs did not.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nMost of the liver densities measured in different areas on three VNCs derived from the multiple phases were significantly different\\nfrom those on TNC. Hepatic steatosis significantly correlated to only liver density measured on TNC, but not on VNCs.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nVirtual non-contrast images derived from the multiple phases of liver DECT may not show similar liver density to true non-contrast\\nimages. So, radiologists should know about the limitations in VNC images to measure the liver density in clinical practice.\\n\\nSSGI08-04 Acute Cholecystitis: Performance of Conventional CT versus Dual-Energy CT\\n\\nParticipants\\nFahimul Huda, MD, Boston, MA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nChristina A.

Informed consent was waived. 65 patients who underwent IV\\ncontrast-enhanced abdominal DECT on a GE Revolution or Philips iQon scanner from 9/1/18-1/30/20 were studied, including 32 with\\nacute abdominal pain, subsequent cholecystectomy and pathology-confirmed acute cholecystitis, and 33 sequential patients\\nwithout pain. An abdominal radiologist reviewed the images in two sessions separated by 4 weeks, blinded to clinical data. Initially,\\nonly conventional CT images were reviewed. Subsequently, conventional and DECT reconstructions including low keV and Iodine\\nmaps were reviewed. Individual findings including gallbladder fossa hyperemia, gangrene and heterogeneous wall enhancement were\\nassessed. Frequency distribution and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were calculated.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nGallbladder fossa hyperemia was detected at CT in 31% (10/32) of cholecystitis patients and 0/33 normal patients (AUC 0.656\\n[95% CI: 0.528 to 0.770]), and at DECT in 66% (21/32) of cholecystitis patients and 3% (1/33) of normal patients (AUC 0.813\\n[95% CI: 0.697 to 0.899]). AUC difference reached statistical significance (p=0.0005). Heterogeneous wall enhancement was\\ndetected at CT in 13% (4/32) of cholecystitis patients and 0/33 normal patients (AUC 0.563 [95% CI: 0.434 to 0.685]), and at\\nDECT in 38% (12/32) of cholecystitis patients and 0/33 of normal patients (AUC 0.688 [95% CI: 0.560 to 0.797]). AUC difference\\nreached statistical significance (p= 0.005). Of 32 patients with histologically confirmed cholecystitis, 8 demonstrated gangrene at\\npathology. Gangrene was detected at CT in 13% (1/8) of patients with confirmed gangrene and 4% (1/24) of cholecystitis patients\\nwithout gangrene (AUC 0.542 [95% CI: 0.357 to 0.718]), and at DECT in 63% (5/8) of patients with confirmed gangrene, and 13%\\n(3/24) of cholecystitis patients without gangrene (AUC 0.75 [95% CI: 0.566 to 0.885]).

The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the psoas muscle lean volume measured on dual-energy CT\\n(DECT) can predict RDI in HCC patients treated with lenvatinib.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThis IRB-approved retrospective study included 43 HCC patients (32 men, 11 women; median age, 71 years) treated with lenvatinib\\nwho underwent DECT before treatment. The psoas muscle area (cm2) at the third lumbar vertebra level and volume (cm3) were\\nmeasured on non-contrast DECT images. The psoas muscle lean volume (cm3) was calculated as psoas muscle volume × (100 - fat\\nfraction [%])/100, where the fat fraction was measured using the three-material decomposition algorithm. To standardize the\\nvalue, the psoas muscle index for the area (PMI-A), the volume (PMI-V), and the lean volume (PMI-LV) were provided by dividing\\nby height squared (m2). The 4- and 8-week RDI were calculated as the ratio of the actual dose delivered to the standard\\nrecommended dose during the initial 4 and 8 weeks. The Spearman\\'s rank correlation was used to analyze the association of the\\nPMI-A, PMI-V, and PMI-LV with the RDIs. The univariate Cox hazard analysis was used to evaluate the impact of the RDIs on\\nprogression-free survival (PFS).\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe measured mean fat fraction within the psoas muscle volume was 15.7 ± 4.2% (range, 6.9-24.5). The mean values of PMI-A,\\nPMI-V, and PMI-LV were 5.8 ± 1.5 cm2/m2, 93.0 ± 22.2 cm3/m2, and 79.0 ± 21.4 cm3/m2, respectively. The median 4- and 8-\\nweek RDI were 0.82 and 0.63. The median PFS was 199 days. PMI-A was not significantly correlated with the 4- or 8-week RDI.\\nPMI-V was significantly correlated with the 4-week (ρ=0.347, P=0.023) and the 8-week (ρ=0.303, P=0.048) RDI. PMI-LV showed\\nbetter correlation with the 4-week (ρ=0.36, P=0.018) and the 8-week (ρ=0.334, P=0.029) RDI. The 4- and 8-week RDI were\\nsignificant factors for PFS (HR, 0.39; P=0.035 and HR, 0.023; P<0.001, respectively).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nPsoas muscle had various fat fraction. In HCC patients treated with lenvatinib, PMI-LV measured on DECT correlated with the 4-\\nand 8-week RDI that were significant factors for PFS.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThe psoas muscle lean volume measured on dual-energy CT correlates with relative dose intensity in patients with HCC treated with\\nlenvatinib, potentially helping to predict the antitumor effect.\\n\\nSSGI08-06 Liver and Body Fat Quantification: Dual Source Dual Energy Computed Tomography Compared to\\n\\nMagnetic Resonance Multi-Echo Dixon Imaging\\n\\nParticipants\\nSebastian Gassenmaier, MD, Tubingen, Germany (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nKarin Kaehm, Tuebingen, Germany (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nChristoph P.

The final study group\\nconsisted of 45 patients with 48 pairs of examinations. Analysis of parameter maps was performed manually using congruent regions\\nof interest (ROI) which were placed into liver parenchyma avoiding focal liver lesions and vessels. To compensate for possible liver\\nparenchyma changes during the time frame of MRI and DECT, additional ROI were drawn into the left and right paravertebral\\nmuscles. These ROI encompassed the whole muscle parenchyma of one slice. Bony landmarks were used to identify the same slice\\non MRI and DECT.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nMean patient age was 60 ± 14 years.

Thus, distinction of\\nbenign/indolent tumors that can be monitored from clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common and aggressive form\\nof cancer, would be valuable. Our goal was to assess the performance of a clear cell likelihood score (ccLS) derived from\\nmultiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) across all clinical stages.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThis was an IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant retrospective analysis of prospectively generated clinical data. Prospectively assigned\\nccLS of renal masses between 06/2016 and 11/2019 were reviewed. ccLS were correlated with histologic diagnosis when available.\\nDiagnostic performance for diagnosing ccRCC and post-test probabilities of ccLS were quantified by contingency table analysis.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\n993 mpMRIs were prospectively assigned ccLS by 1 of 16 fellowship-trained radiologists. Of these, 463 renal masses (444 patients)\\nhad subsequent pathologic diagnosis via renal biopsy (66) or surgical excision (397) and represent the study cohort. Distribution of\\nmasses with and without pathology by ccLS and clinical stage is shown in Fig. 1a and b. In the study cohort, 22% masses were\\nccLS 1-2, 14% ccLS 3, and 64% ccLS 4-5; 47% were clinical stage T1a, 22% T1b, and 31% T2-4. Fig. 1c shows pathology\\ndistribution across ccLS. The sensitivity and specificity of ccLS >=4 in diagnosing ccRCC are 89.3% and 78.6%, respectively. The\\nsensitivity and specificity of ccLS >=3 in diagnosing ccRCC are 97.6% and 56.1%, respectively. Diagnostic accuracy improved in\\nhigher stage tumors (p = 0.0025).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nA non-invasive diagnosis of ccRCC in patients with renal masses using mpMRI can be achieved with reasonable clinical performance\\nin a busy clinical practice with a large number of interpreting radiologists. ccLS performance improved in larger tumors.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nImplementation of ccLS in clinical practice can help reduce the number of renal biopsies prior to surgical resection (95.6% of ccLS\\n4-5 were malignant).

Images were divided into training and testing sets\\nin an 8:2 ratio. Images were manually segmented using 3D Slicer software. For each image space, a total of 3,087 radiomics\\nfeatures were computed, including texture and non-texture features. All features were normalized and combined in one dataset\\nwith the clinical variables (age, gender, race, laterality, and location). 10 classifiers and 13 feature selection methods were\\nscreened to identify the most optimized pipeline for differentiation of ccRCCs with low (<4) SSIGN from those with high SSIGN (>4).\\nIn addition, TPOT, a Tree-Based Pipeline Optimization Tool was run on the dataset. TPOT was trained 10 times using 5-folds cross\\nvalidation on training set of 291 patients. Then, the best performing model from our optimization process and the model generated\\nby TPOT were tested on a set of 73 patients.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThere were 272 cases with low SSIGN score (<4) and 92 cases with high SSIGN score (>=4). The Bayesian classifier along with\\nJoint Mutual Information feature selection achieved a top test accuracy of 0.86 (CI:0.76-0.93), sensitivity of 0.74 (CI:0.51-0.89),\\nand specificity of 0.91 (CI:0.80-0.96) with an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC AUC) of 0.91. The TPOT\\nexported pipeline achieved a test accuracy of 0.88 (CI: 0.78-0.94), sensitivity of 0.74 (CI:0.51-0.89), and specificity of 0.93\\n(CI:0.82-0.98) with a ROC AUC of 0.94. There was no significant difference in performance metrics between the hand optimized\\nmodel from our optimization process and the pipeline selected by TPOT.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nRadiomics model based on routine MRI can predict SSIGN score of ccRCC with good accuracy. This study suggests that radiomics\\nhas potential in predicting the prognosis of patients with ccRCC prior to any invasive management.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nDespite the prevalence of ccRCC, there is no method to predict its prognosis prior to an invasive therapy.

The cohort was divided into training, validation, and test sets in a 7:2:1 ratio. T1C and T2WI images were manually\\nsegmented on 3D Slicer software (v4.6). T1C and T2WI models were trained using ResNet50 architecture. Clinical variables (age,\\ngender, and tumor volume) were fed into a logistic regression model for prediction of malignancy. Afterwards, an ensemble model\\ncombining the clinical variable logistic regression model, T1C model, and T2WI model were made using a bagging classifier. The test\\nset was blindly evaluated by radiologists without and then with AI assistance.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThere were 576 malignant tumors, including 389 (67.5%) clear-cell real cell carcinomas (RCCs), 124 (21.5%) papillary RCCs, 25\\n\\n\\x0cThere were 576 malignant tumors, including 389 (67.5%) clear-cell real cell carcinomas (RCCs), 124 (21.5%) papillary RCCs, 25\\n(4.3%) chromophobe RCCs, 27 (4.7%) clear cell papillary RCCs, and 11 (1.9%) other RCC subtypes. There were 267 benign tumors,\\nincluding 89 (33.3%) oncocytomas, 171 (64%) angiomyolipomas, and 7 (2.7%) other subtypes. The final model achieved a test\\naccuracy of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.72 - 0.89), sensitivity of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.73 - 0.89), specificity of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.71 - 0.88), ROC\\nAUC of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.79 - 0.93), and PR AUC of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.77 - 0.92). Compared to all experts averaged, the final\\nensemble model combining MR imaging and clinical features had a higher test accuracy (0.82 vs 0.69, p = 0.014), sensitivity (0.82\\nvs 0.74, p = 0.158), and specificity (0.81 vs 0.59, p = 0.017) in test set. Assisted by the model\\'s probabilities, the experts\\nachieved a higher average test accuracy (0.83 vs 0.69, Δ = 0.14, p < 0.001), sensitivity (0.92 vs 0.74, Δ = 0.18, p < 0.001), and\\nspecificity (0.64 vs 0.59, Δ = 0.05, p = 0.458).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nAI assistance improved radiologist performance in distinguishing benign from malignant renal mass.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nMachine learning using routine MRI provides a non-invasive method to differentiate renal cell carcinoma from benign mass.

Patients with\\npolycystic kidney disease were excluded due to rapid growth rate of the cysts. All patients were followed-up at least two times,\\nshort-term (defined as <6 months, median 1 month) and long-term (defined as >1 year, median 13 months), by ultrasound or CT.\\nSuboptimal treatment response was defined as the volume of residual cyst >20ml in each follow-up. Predictive variables of clinical,\\nCT findings, and technical factors were analyzed by logistic regression analysis.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nTechnically, all the patients tolerated the procedures. Suboptimal treatment response rates were 40.3%, 19.4% at short-term and\\nlong-term follow-up, respectively. Median cyst diameter and volume reduction were 62.8% (IQR 53.2-70.8%), 94.8% (IQR 90.5-\\n97.2%) in short-term follow-up, and 72.9% (IQR 63.2-82.9%), 98.0% (95.9-99.4%) in long-term follow-up. In multivariate analysis,\\npatients with suboptimal treatment response in short-term follow-up showed more frequent estimated cyst volume >300ml (OR\\n14.1, 95% CI 3.31-60, P<0.001) and sinus protrusion (OR 9.8, 95% CI 1.03-93.01, P = 0.047). However, there was no significant\\nindependent factors for predicting treatment response in long-term follow-up.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nSuboptimal treatment response in short-term follow-up were associated with greater estimated volume (>300ml) and protrusion to\\nsinus of the cyst in pretreatment CT. However, these variables did not predict long-term treatment response.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nLarge cysts (>300ml) or cysts with sinus protrusion had higher risk of incomplete collapse after aspiration sclerotherapy in short-\\nterm follow up, despite these factors did not affect long-term treatment response.\\n\\nSSGU01-06 Complex Cystic Renal Lesions: CT Imaging-based Radiomics Model for Preoperative Malignancy Risk\\n\\nStratification in Comparison with Bosniak Classification\\n\\nParticipants\\nJeremy T.

Patients with genetic conditions associated with multiple renal cysts were excluded. The standard of reference\\n\\n\\x0cincluded histology and/or follow-up of at least 4 years by CT or MRI without any changes in the Bosniak classification. Bosniak\\nclassification was assigned in consensus by two experienced abdominal radiologists. In order to obtain a balanced distribution of CT\\nfeatures, the training and independent testing sets (from two different institutions) contained a similar number of patients in each\\nBosniak category. 3D radiomic features (212) were extracted from segmented whole volume renal cysts on contrast-enhanced\\n(nephrographic phase) CT images using the PyRadiomics Python package. A random forest classifier was trained to differentiate\\nmalignant from benign CCRL. The 20 most important features for the diagnosis of malignancy were identified and a second model\\nwas trained, validated, and tested on this subset of features.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nWe included 149 CCRL in the training/validation set and 50 CCRL in the independent external testing set (10 Bosniak I, 9 Bosniak II,\\n12 Bosniak IIF, 9 Bosniak III and 10 Bosniak IV) between 2005 and 2018. Our model based on the 20 most important features\\nresulted in a similar performance between the training set (AUC = 0.92 [0.83-1.00]) and the testing set (AUC = 0.92). Sensitivity,\\nspecificity, and balanced accuracy were 89%, 100%, and 91%. All benign CCRL were correctly predicted irrespective of Bosniak\\ncategories. The only proven malignant Bosniak IIF lesion in the testing dataset was predicted as benign using the random forest\\nclassifier but with a higher risk of malignancy than the benign Bosniak IIF lesions. Twelve of the sixteen malignant CCRL were\\ncorrectly predicted.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nOur radiomics model shows strong performance in distinguishing benign from malignant CCRL, especially for prediction of benign\\nlesions. This work was jointly funded by the Fonds de recherche du Québec - Santé (FRQS) and the Fondation de l\\'association des\\nradiologistes du Québec (FARQ).\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nBosniak classification allows stratification of the risk of malignancy of complex cystic renal lesions on CT scans. Its limitations lie in\\nnon-optimal grading of lesion complexity between categories IIF and III.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSGU05\\n\\nGenitourinary (Gynecologic Oncology)\\n\\nW ednesday, Dec. 2 10:00AM - 11:00AM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nCT GI MR PH OI\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .50\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSGU05-01 Comparison of O-RAD Classification and Simple Features to Evaluate Adnexal Masses Using\\n\\nUltrasound\\n\\nParticipants\\nMostafa Atri, MD, Toronto, ON (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nFatemeh Nasri, Toronto, ON (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJonathon Solnik, Toronto, ON (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nGenevieve Bouchard-Fortier, Toronto, ON (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nmostafa.atri@uhn.ca\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo compare accuracy of ultrasound using simple features and O-RAD classification to predict benign/malignant nature of an adnexal\\nmass\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThis is an Institutional Ethics Board approved retrospective study with waiver of consent. Video clips of US examinations of adnexal\\nmasses of consecutive patients who underwent surgery at two institutions (one consisted of gynecologists and one gyne\\noncologists) were reviewed by an abdominal radiologist blinded to the final pathology. Lesions were scored as benign or malignant,\\nusing predetermined criteria for benignancy or malignancy. A mass was called benign if it was unilocular, multilocular without focal\\nseptal thickening or nodularity, contained low level echoes/mural echogenic foci/attenuating nodule (endometriotic cyst), echogenic\\nattenuating component (dermoid) or hypoechoic attenuating component (fibrous tissue).

The patients then underwent CEUS examination on a Siemens S-3000 contrast enabled\\nscanner, following intravenous injection of 2.4 ml SonovueTM. Real time scan video clips were captured for 180 seconds. The clips\\nwere analyzed for Qltv pa: enhancement order, extent & contrast distribution.

Imaging\\nevidence was included officially in the new staging system. 360°-three-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound (360°-3D TVUS) is an\\nemerging, innovative diagnostic imaging tool. In this work, we aim to compare two-dimensional (2D) and 360°-3D TVUS with\\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the gold standard in assessment of vaginal invasion of cervical cancer and to determine if all\\nparts of the vaginal are equally assessable with ultrasound.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nPatients with macroscopically evident and histologically confirmed cervical cancer were staged using FIGO criteria and underwent\\nMRI, and 2D and 360°-3D TVUS examination before treatment. When assessing vaginal invasion with 360°-3D TVUS and MRI, the\\nvaginal was (virtually) divided into 12 points and 2 segments (the upper two-thirds, and the lower third of the vagina). The\\npresence and the extent of vaginal invasion were recorded for each sector. Results of 2D, 360°-3D TVUS, and MRI were compared\\nand reported in terms of percentage agreement and kappa value.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nA total of 36 consecutive patients were included in the work. All patients underwent 360°-3D TVUS without adverse reactions. The\\npercentage agreement between 2D TVUS and MRI in assessing vaginal invasion (yes or no) was 75% (kappa, 0.491) and that\\nbetween 360°-3D TVUS and MRI was 96.9% (kappa, 0.842). The results of 2D TVUS showed the following agreement with those of\\nMRI: 66.7% for the upper two-thirds of the vagina (kappa, 0.400), 75% for the lower third of the vagina (kappa, 0.667). The\\nresults of 360°-3D TVUS showed the following agreement with those of MRI: 92.3% for the upper two-thirds of the vagina (kappa,\\n0.713), 88.9% for the lower third of the vagina (kappa, 0.800). Compared with MRI, 360°-3D TVUS can more clearly show the\\nextent and specific range of lesions invading the vagina, as well as the distance from the lowermost end of the lesion to the\\nurethral opening and the cervical opening.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe results of 360°-3D TVUS showed good agreement with MRI, which is less costly and more readily available than MRI and should\\nbe considered in the pre-treatment work-up for cervical cancer.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\n360°-3D TVUS is equal to MRI in detecting vaginal invasion and is recommended in the pre-treamt evaluation of cervical cancer\\n\\n\\x0cPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSGU07\\n\\nScience Session with Keynote: Genitourinary (PI-RADS)\\n\\nMonday, Nov. 30 5:00PM - 6:00PM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nRO\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .50\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSGU07-01 Genitourinary Keynote Speaker: PI-RADS: the Evolution Continues\\n\\nParticipants\\nSilvia D.

From the mpMRI report, we identified all men with a PR-3 (n=423). We excluded those with a prior diagnosis of csPCa\\n(Gleason Score [GS] >= 3+4) (n=42), prior prostate treatment (n=17) or those with no follow-up pathology (n=42). Procedure-\\nrelated data was recorded for all PR-3: type (biopsy/surgery); number per patient; and timing of procedure. Serum PSA, prostate\\nvolume and PSA density at the time of mpMRI was recorded. Reference pathology from prostatectomy over biopsy, or the highest\\nGS from all biopsies, were used to classify patients as having no PCa, non-csPCa (GS=3+3), or csPCa. The Tukey-Kramer pairwise\\ncomparison test was used to compare mean prostate volume, PSA and PSA density. Poisson regression was used to compared\\nprocedure number per patient among groups.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\n292 men (age: 63.3±7.4 years) with a PR-3 underwent 713 procedures: biopsy (n=639; 90%), prostatectomy (n=59; 8%),\\ntransurethral resection 2% (n=15; 8%). The follow-up period was <1 to 4.9 years. Pathology outcomes were: csPCa 26% (n=77),\\nnon-csPCa 51% (n=149), no PCa 23% (n=66). Those who were diagnosed with csPCa did so over 8.3±10.2 months [0.13-48.7].\\nThe csPCa group had lower prostate volumes (56.1±50.8mL) compared to no PCa (82.9±54.2mL; p<0.0001), and higher PSA\\ndensities (0.162±0.100ng/mL2) vs. non-csPCa (0.114±0.089 ng/mL2) and vs. no PCa (0.119±0.114ng/mL2), p<0.02 for both. Those\\nwho were diagnosed with PCa had greater number of procedures (2.8±1.2 and 2.6±1.3 for csPCa and non-csPCa) compared to\\nthose with no PCa (1.7±1); p< 0.0001.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIn this population 26% were diagnosed with csPCa within 8.3±10.2 months [0.13-48.7] of PR-3 assessment. Those who were\\ndiagnosed with csPCa had a higher PSA density at the time of mpMRI. A subsequent diagnosis of PCa in those with a PR-3 on MRI is\\nassociated with a higher number of procedures.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nClinically significant prostate cancer is common in those with PI-RADS 3 assessment on MRI. It is associated with increase in PSA\\ndensity and increased number of procedures for pathological diagnosis.\\n\\nSSGU07-04 Two Readers Validation of Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) version 2.1 for\\n\\nDetection of Prostate Cancer with Whole Mount Histopathology Correlation on 3 Tesla\\nMultiparametric MRI\\n\\nParticipants\\nVoraparee Suvannarerg, MD, Bangkok , Thailand (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nTeeravut Tubtawee, MD, Hatyai, Thailand (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nMelina Hosseiny, MD, Los Angeles, CA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nSohrab Afshari Mirak, MD, Beverly Hills, CA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nHolden H.

All peripheral zone (PZ) lesions were\\nretrospectively reviewed according to PI-RADS v2.1 and transitional zone (TZ) lesions were evaluated with both PI-RADS v2.1 and\\nv2.0 by two genitourinary radiologists (GU-R). All discrepancies PI-RADS scores were consensus with senior GU-R. The diagnostic\\nperformance was calculated including sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and area under curve (AUC) for PI-RADS assessment\\nthreshold categories >= 3 and >= 4 to diagnose PCa and clinically significant PCa (csPCa > Gleason group 2). The weighted kappa\\nmethod was used to calculated inter-reader reliability.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\n\\x0cIn the 514 lesions study cohort, 87.5% (450/514), and 74.7% (384/514) were PCa and csPCa while 12.5% (64/514) were benign.\\nThe detection rate of csPCa for PI-RADS v2.1 category 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 4.8% (1/21), 35% (35/100), 85.5% (201/235), and\\n93% (147/158), respectively. The AUC of TZ lesions was higher than PZ lesions (Table1). The inter-reader agreement of whole\\ngland (K=0.76) and PZ lesions (K=0.80) was significantly higher than for TZ lesions (K=0.60). PI-RADS v2.1 in TZ lesions had higher\\nsensitivity and NPV and lower specificity for diagnosing PCa and csPCa when compared with v2.0 by using threshold score >= 3 and\\nscore >= 4. The detection rate of csPCa in the TZ for PI-RADS v2.1 vs 2.0 for score 2 was 0% vs 12.5%. The csPCa detection rate\\nin the TZ was similar for PI-RADS v2.1 vs 2.0 for scores 3 (34.7%, 39.5%), 4 (80%, 78.6%), and 5 (92.9%, 95%), respectively.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIn this study there was excellent inter-reader agreement for whole gland and PZ and good agreement for TZ. Over performance for\\ndiagnosing PCa and csPCa using PI-RADS v2.1 was high.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nPI-RADS v2.1 has a high diagnostic performance to diagnose PC and csPC with high inter-reader reliability.\\n\\nSSGU07-05 Comparison of PI-RADS v2.0 and v2.1 for Evaluation of Transition Zone Lesions: A 5-Reader 202-\\n\\nPatient Analysis\\n\\nParticipants\\nNancy Kim, MD, Washington, DC (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nSooah Kim, MD, New York, NY (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nVinay Prabhu, MD, Brooklyn, NY (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nKrishna Prasad Shanbhogue, MD, Jersey City, NJ (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nPaul Smereka, MD, Brooklyn, NY (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nAngela Tong, MD, New York, NY (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nRebecca Anthopolos, New York, NY (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nSamir S.

Cases were randomized using a crossover\\ndesign whereby half in the 1st session were reviewed using v2.0 and the other half using v2.1, and vice versa for the 2nd session.\\nReaders, informed of the location of the biopsied lesion, provided T2WI and DWI scores using v2.0 or v2.1 criteria. PI-RADS scores\\nwere derived.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nInter-reader agreement had kappa of 0.36 for v2.0 and 0.25 for v2.1. For 4 readers, the percentage of lesions retrospectively-\\nscored PI-RADS 1 increased >5% from v2.0 to v2.1 (R2: 0% to 11%; R3: 7% to 25%; R4: 0% to 19%; R5: 0% to 31%). For 4\\nreaders, the percentage scored PI-RADS 2 decreased >5% (R1: 23% to 17%; R3: 41% to 25%; R4: 50% to 17%; R5: 41% to\\n26%). For 2 readers, the percentage scored PI-RADS 3 decreased >5% (R2: 33% to 27%; R5: 39% to 22%), and for 2 readers\\nincreased >5% (R1: 32% to 37%; R4: 15% to 27%). The percentage of PI-RADS 4 and 5 lesions changed <5% for all readers. For\\nthe 4 readers with increased frequency of retrospectively-scored PI-RADS 1 lesions using v2.1, these PI-RADS 1 lesions were GS\\n>=3+4 in 4%, 8%, 8%, and 16%. Frequency of GS >=3+4 in PI-RADS 3 lesions increased for R3 (36% to 43%) and R5 (33% to\\n38%) and decreased for R4 (37% to 26%). Sensitivity of PI-RADS >=3 for GS >=3+4 ranged 76-90% for v2.0 and 69-96% for v2.1.\\nSpecificity ranged 32-64% for v2.0 and 25-72% for v2.1. PPV ranged 43-55% for v2.0 and 41-58% for v2.1. NPV ranged 82-87%\\nfor v2.0 and 81-91% for v2.1. PPV and NPV varied <10% between v2.0 and v2.1 for all readers.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nTZ inter-reader agreement was poor for both versions, but worse for v2.1. Though v2.1 resulted in a large shift from a score of 2\\nto 1, 4-16% of retrospectively-scored PI-RADS 1 were GS >=3+4. v2.1 yielded an inconsistent small increase or decrease in PI-\\nRADS 3 lesions. v2.0 and v2.1 both demonstrated variable performance, with inconsistent small shifts in accuracy between versions\\nand no clear improvement for v2.1.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThe observed reduced inter-reader agreement and lack of improvement in diagnostic accuracy raise concern regarding the clinical\\nperformance of PI-RADS v2.1.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSHS03\\n\\nHealth Service, Policy and Research (Patient and Family Centered Care)\\n\\nSunday, Nov. 29 5:00PM - 6:00PM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nBR HP OI\\n\\nPR SQ\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .75\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSHS03-01 Point-of-Care Synchronous Virtual Radiology Consultations: Preliminary Results from A Cluster-\\n\\nRandomized Study in Primary Care Patients\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Fellow\\n\\nParticipants\\nDania Daye, MD, PhD, Medford, MA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nEvita Joseph, MBBS, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nNikhita Nambiar, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nGarrett Chinn, MD, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nEfren J.

The purpose of\\nthis study is to assess the value of point-of-care virtual radiology consultations in a randomized study.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nIn this IRB-approved feasibility study, 91 patients were enrolled between September 2019 and February 2020. Patients were\\ncluster-randomized to control (n=47) and intervention arms (n=44) with the following inclusion criteria of: 1) age >45 years; 2)\\nconsult with PCP; 3) a recent CT of the chest or abdomen. The patients in the control and intervention arms were age- and\\ngender-matched. In the intervention arm, a virtual real-time radiology consultation with referring PCPs and the patient was\\nconducted with review of CT images focused on extent of vascular atherosclerosis. In the control arm, PCPs followed the standard\\nof care without virtual radiology consultation. Primary study endpoints consisted of patient-reported understanding of their disease\\nand changes in PCP prescriptions of statins and anti-hypertensives. Data was collected via internally-validated surveys. Statistical\\nsignificance was assessed using Fisher\\'s exact test.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\n30 patients in the intervention arm and 25 patients in the control arm completed the study (Control: 66% female, mean age: 71\\nyears; intervention: 67% female, mean age: 66 years). Discussion of the imaging findings by the PCP with the patient occurred in\\nall patients in the intervention arm, while discussion of imaging findings by PCP with the patients occurred only in 2 in every 5 cases\\nin the control arm (P<0.001). All patients in the intervention arm indicated that seeing or discussing their images improved their\\nunderstanding of their disease while only 2 in every 4 patients in the control arm did (P=0.04). In the intervention arm, 33% of\\npatients left the PCP visit with a change in a prescription for statins or antihypertensives, while only 12% of patients in the control\\narm did (P=0.03).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nPreliminary results from a cluster-randomized trial shows that radiology-led virtual visits has a positive effect on patient shared\\ndecision-making metrics and might change PCP management decisions.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nVirtual radiology consults have the potential to advance radiology\\'s value in care delivery by providing more personalized radiology\\ncare and by promoting patient-centered practice models.\\n\\nSSHS03-02 Prospective Survey of Hepatobiliary Conference Cases at an Oncology Center: Role of Imaging and\\n\\nImpact of Imaging Errors on Management\\n\\nParticipants\\nVeronica L.

In complex oncologic cases, radiologist errors can complicate\\nmanagement plans or potentially set them on the wrong course altogether. The purpose of our project is to prospectively\\ncharacterize the role of imaging in hepatobiliary cases presented at multidisciplinary conference (MDC) at an oncology center, and\\nattempt to quantify the impact of second review on management.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\n113 cases referred to hepatobiliary MDC for review and discussion as per hospital routine were prospectively collected and classified\\ninto groups according to referral information, presence of imaging errors, original management plan (prior to MDC) and final\\nmanagement plan (after MDC).\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe majority of cases (80%) were referred to hepatobiliary MDC for clinical rather than specific imaging questions (usually\\n\"treatment selection\"); management depended upon imaging findings 96% of the time. Original imaging interpretation was revised by\\nliver MDC radiologists 36% of the time, with most revisions made to reports by abdominal imagers who are not part of the liver MDC\\n(p=0.03). Revisions to original interpretation resulted in a change of management 42% of the time. Colorectal liver metastases\\n(CLM) and cholangiocarcinoma cases were the most frequently revised, with most management changes occurring from revisions to\\nCLM cases (41%). Clinical and imaging questions were answered by available imaging 95% of the time, rarely needing further\\nimaging or biopsy. Liver-group radiologists reviewed an average of 5 imaging studies per case, with a range of 1-14.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nManagement for the vast majority of cases brought to conference was dependent upon imaging findings; the decisions were made\\nusing available imaging, often multiple priors, without need for further studies. Input of liver MDC radiologists resulted in revised\\nmanagement 42% of the time. Most revisions were made to reports originally done by abdominal imagers without liver-focused\\nspecialization.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nSecond review of challenging hepatobiliary cases by organ-focused imagers impacts management in up to 42% of cases.\\n\\nSSHS03-03 Improved Readability of the Screening Mammography Recall Lay Letter Improves Patient Follow-up\\n\\nParticipants\\nDerek Nguyen, MD, Baltimore, MD (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nSusan C.

In the setting of an abnormal screening mammogram, the Mammography Quality Standards Act\\n(MQSA) mandates that patients receive a mailed \"recall\" lay letter informing them to return for additional follow-up imaging. MQSA\\nstates that the language used in this letter should be \"easily understood by a lay person.\" The Centers for Disease Control and\\nPrevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommend that all written patient communication should have\\nbetween a 6th and 8th grade reading level. On February 15, 2019, our institution revised the language of our recall lay letter to the\\nappropriate 6th grade reading level from a 12th grade reading level. This was implemented across all four of our institution\\'s\\noutpatient breast imaging sites. We hypothesize that the lack of readability of our previous recall lay letter may have led to patient\\nmisinterpretation, thus resulting in delayed or no patient follow-up. Therefore, the purpose of our study is to analyze the effect of\\nimplementing an updated letter on patient follow-up rates.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThis study included 1987 patients in the pre-intervention group and 2210 patients in the post-intervention group. The overall\\npatient follow-up rate within 60 days increased from 90.0% (1790/1987) in the pre-intervention group to 93.9% (2076/2210) in the\\npost-intervention group (p < 0.001). The imaging site serving the population with the lowest percentage (81.5%) of high school\\ngraduates or higher had the most improvement in follow-up within 60 days from 86.0% (208/242) to 93.3% (237/254) (p = 0.01).\\nThe imaging site serving the population with the highest percentage (96.5%) of high school graduates or higher initially began with\\na high follow-up rate and did not significantly change after the intervention from 94.0% (625/665) to 94.9% (732/771) (p = 0.5).\\nOverall, even when controlling for imaging site, patients in the post-intervention group had 1.68 increased odds of returning for a\\ndiagnostic follow-up examination within 60 days compared to the pre-intervention group (95% CI 1.34-2.11). When controlling for\\nintervention group, however, patients from the imaging site serving the population with the lowest education level had 0.52\\ndecreased odds of returning for follow-up examination within 60 days (95% CI 0.36-0.75). Therefore, while the intervention overall\\nimproved patient follow-up, disparities based on education persisted.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nRevising our institution\\'s recall lay letter to an appropriate reading grade level significantly improves timely patient follow-up in the\\nsetting of an abnormal screening mammogram. Our data demonstrates the direct impact of improved readability on patient follow-up\\n\\n\\x0cadherence to the federally mandated written patient communication, particularly in setting of lower education. Thus, revising the\\nlanguage utilized in screening mammography recall lay letters to less than an 8th grade reading level can positively impact patient\\nadherence and facilitate more inclusivity for patients of diverse educational backgrounds. This will enable better patient\\nunderstanding of these letters and increase the effectiveness of breast cancer screening for women of all educational levels.\\n\\nMETHODS\\n\\nThis retrospective study reviewed data from all screening mammograms at our institution with a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data\\nSystem (BI-RADS) 0 assessment excluding technical recalls between 2/15/18-2/14/19 (pre-intervention group) and 2/15/19-\\n2/14/20 (post-intervention group). Studies were performed at our institution\\'s four breast imaging sites, each serving a\\ngeographically different patient population. The most common zip code among patients attending screening mammography at each\\nsite was used as a general representation for the educational diversity of each population. The percentage of high school\\ngraduates or higher derived from these zip codes was obtained from the 2013-2017 US Census Bureau. Our primary outcome was\\nthe percentage of patients in each intervention group who returned for their diagnostic follow-up examination within 60 days\\n(standard recommended by the CDC). We evaluated this outcome overall and stratified by imaging site using the Chi square test.\\nMultivariate logistic regression was done to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for follow-up within 60 days with\\nintervention group and imaging site included as covariates.\\n\\nSSHS03-04 Cascade of Care Framework Can Examine Racial Disparities in Adherence among Patients with\\n\\nIncidental Pulmonary Nodules\\n\\nParticipants\\nRebecca A.

Mortani Barbosa JR, MD, Philadelphia, PA (Presenter) Research Consultant, FluiddaResearch Grant, Siemens AG\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo assess the value of a cascade of care framework for evaluating racial disparities in adherence to follow-up of incidental\\npulmonary nodules.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nWe reviewed electronic medical record and U.S. Census data for 1,562 patients diagnosed with incidental pulmonary nodules\\nidentified on chest CT in a tertiary healthcare system in 2016, and examined their follow-up adherence cascades until 2019.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nDisparities between non-White/White patients exist on each step of the adherence pathway, particularly between diagnosis and\\nprovider-patient communication of incidental findings (55% for Black patients, 80% for Whites); between communication and\\nordering/scheduling of follow-up imaging/procedures, and between ordering/scheduling and timely adherence (29% for Black\\npatients, 54% for Whites). Modeling adherence, we find non-White patients present increased odds of never adhering and delaying\\nadherence compared with White patients (OR 1.3 and 2.5 for Black patients, respectively, p < 0.05), controlling for\\nsociodemographic, communication, and health characteristics.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nWe demonstrate substantial gaps in adherence to follow up of incidental pulmonary nodules between non-White/White patients,\\nwhich is lessened by provider-patient communication. Moreover, our methods can pinpoint exactly where in the pathway towards\\nadherence patients may fall off (Figure 1), enabling specific target for health policy interventions.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nOur research has major implications for clinical practice and public health policy, as adherence disparities are a key mechanism\\nthrough which health disparities across racial groups continue to be produced and maintained, leading to worse outcomes for\\ndisadvantaged racial/ethnic groups.\\n\\nSSHS03-05 Longitudinal Changes in Multiple Sclerosis Patient-Reported Financial Toxicity and Its Impact on\\n\\nClinical Care and Imaging Non-Adherence\\n\\nParticipants\\nGelareh Sadigh, MD, Atlanta, GA (Presenter) Research funded, TailorMed Medical Inc\\nJeffrey Switchenko, PhD, Atlanta, GA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nNeil Lava, MD, Atlanta, GA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nRichard Duszak JR, MD, Atlanta, GA (Abstract Co-Author) Advisor, Ethos Medical, Inc; Shareholder, Ethos Medical, Inc\\nRichard Duszak JR, MD, Atlanta, GA (Abstract Co-Author) Advisor, Ethos Medical, Inc; Shareholder, Ethos Medical, Inc\\nElizabeth A.

FT was\\nmeasured at baseline, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months using the Comprehensive Score for Financial Toxicity (COST) score (range 0-44, the\\nlower the score, the worse the FT). Independent correlates of FT and changes in FT over time were identified using linear\\nregression. Cost-related care non-adherence was defined as patients reporting delaying, forgoing, or changing MS medications,\\noffice visits, laboratory, and imaging testing due to cost concerns. Associations of overall care non-adherence (at any time point)\\n\\n\\x0cwith baseline COST scores and changes in adherence compared with changes in COST scores at baseline and 12 months were\\nassessed using ANOVA.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nIn all, 242 patients were recruited (43±13 years; 77% female; 47% White). Mean COST scores at baseline and 12 months were\\n17.4±10.1 and 19.4±11.1, respectively (P=0.09). Baseline financial self-efficacy (i.e., confidence in managing money) was the only\\nindependent predictor of COST that remained significant at all time points (B coefficient, 1.15 [95% CI, 0.89-1.41] at baseline; and\\n0.99 [95%CI, 0.54-1.43]) at 12 months; P<0.001). No independent predictors for changes in COST score were identified. Overall,\\n85% reported care non-adherence. Patients with care non-adherence had significantly greater FT at baseline (mean COST, 13.3)\\ncompared to those without care non-adherence (23.9) (P<0.001). Patients with improved adherence at 12 months reported a mean\\nimprovement of 7.8 in FT vs. those with persistent (mean -0.39 change in FT) and worsened non-adherence at 12 months (mean\\n0.6 change in FT) (p=0.007).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nAlthough patients with MS are at high risk for FT, their degree of FT does not change over time. However, changes in FT as an\\nadverse event of care is associated with changes in care (including imaging) non-adherence.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nFinancial self-efficacy is a predictor of FT. Targeting interventions to improve financial self-efficacy may reduce FT and improve\\nboth clinical care and imaging non-adherence.\\n\\nSSHS03-06 Impact of a Multidisciplinary Cancer Diagnostic Service on Wait Times for Image GuidedBiopsy in\\n\\nPatients with Suspected New or Metastatic Cancer\\n\\nParticipants\\nIsha Gujrathi, MD,DMRD, Brookline, MA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nLouise I.

Care plans for referred patients were devised by the CDS team, composed of 2 oncologists,\\n2 PCPs, a radiologist and a physician assistant who evaluated all relevant patient information in conference before PCP evaluated\\nthe patient in clinic. We compared the primary outcome, time from initial clinic appointment to tissue biopsy, in 125 of 439 total\\nCDS patients who had image-guided biopsy to 125 randomly selected matched biopsy patients who were not cared for by CDS.\\nSecondary outcome was need for second intervention due to inconclusive initial biopsy. Difference in mean number of days was\\nassessed with unpaired two tailed t-test for unequal variances. We used t-test to assess secondary outcome defined as need for\\nsecond intervention due to inconclusive initial biopsy.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe mean time to biopsy for the CDS patients was 40% lower than the non-CDS patients (6.2 days for CDS vs. 10.4 days for non-\\nCDS; (10.4-6.2)/10.4 x 100=40%; p<0.0001). CDS patients had a 1.37 times higher relative risk of a repeat biopsy (p=0.63).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nCDS patients had 40% shorter wait times for image-guided biopsy. Radiologist-embedded multi-disciplinary clinic evaluation and\\nmanagement of suspected new or metastatic cancer patients may improve patient experience by reducing wasted fear associated\\nwith longer wait times to establish a diagnosis. Although a higher proportion of CDS patients had repeat biopsy, the difference was\\nnot statistically significant. Future studies may be helpful to assess potential contributors to repeat biopsies in CDS patients.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nRadiologist embedded multidisciplinary Cancer Diagnostic Service clinics for management of suspected new or metastatic cancer\\npatients may help to expedite time to image-guided biopsy and thus reduce wasted fear associated with longer wait times to\\nestablish a diagnosis, enhancing overall patient experience.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSIN01\\n\\nInformatics (Artificial Intelligence: The Cutting Edge)\\n\\nTuesday, Dec. 1 2:00PM - 3:00PM Room: Channel 5\\n\\nRO\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .75\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSIN01-01 One Click Guided Automatic RECIST Lesion Measurement and Segmentation on CT Scans\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Fellow\\n\\nParticipants\\nYoubao Tang, PhD, Bethesda, MD (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nKe Yan, Bethesda, MD (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJing Xiao, Shenzhen, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nRonald M.

Manual lesion\\nmeasurement and segmentation are tedious, time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. To reduce this manual burden\\nand inconsistency, we propose a unified framework (\"SEANet\") for automatic and joint lesion SEgmentation and RECIST Annotation\\non a variety of lesion types throughout the body with only one click guidance.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nSEANet has two main parts performed by two convolutional neural networks. The first part extracts the lesion of interest with one-\\nclick guidance and predicts the lesion segmentation and RECIST measurement by multi-task learning. The second part refines the\\nlesion segmentation and RECIST measurement by learning highly discriminative features and considering multi-scale contextual\\ninformation. SEANet was trained and tested on the large-scale DeepLesion dataset composed of 32,735 CT lesion images annotated\\nwith RECIST measurements from 10,594 studies of 4,459 patients. 1,000 images were randomly selected from 500 patients and\\nmanually segmented as a segmentation test set. 500 lesions from 200 patients had three manual RECIST annotations and were\\nused for the RECIST test set. The remaining patients\\' images served as training (90%) and validation (10%) sets.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nFor RECIST annotation, the long and short axis diameter differences of SEANet compared to the manual reference standard were\\n2.8±4.0 mm and 2.1±3.5 mm, while those for the human readers were 3.4±5.2 mm and 2.9±4.5 mm, respectively. These results\\ndemonstrate that our system performs more stably. For lesion segmentation, SEANet achieved a Dice score of 0.912±0.039.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nSEANet allowed clinicians to easily control which lesion to segment and measure by only one click, and then made lesion RECIST\\nmeasurements and segmentations automatically that were comparable in accuracy to that of human readers with reduced labor and\\ntime.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nSEANet is a practical tool for clinicians to generate accurate lesion RECIST measurements and segmentations with minimal human\\neffort and may have a positive impact on oncologic image analysis workflows.\\n\\nSSIN01-02 Improving Vertebral Fracture Detection in Standard Chest X-Rays Using an Ensemble of Image Views\\n\\nParticipants\\nLarissa C.

A robust AI algorithm for standard chest x-rays that uses\\navailable images may reduce the rate of missing these injuries.\\n\\n\\x0cBackground\\n\\nSpine fractures are powerful predictors of future spine and hip fractures. Yet, up to 30% go undiagnosed in the acute phase, often\\nbeing missed on standard x-rays. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for x-rays can potentially reduce the rate of missed vertebral\\nfractures and facilitate early intervention. Most AI work in spinal evaluation on x-ray has focused on lateral images, with limited\\nwork on frontal images. Although such injuries are better seen on lateral views, many routine chest x-rays only include the frontal\\nview. An AI pipeline that accommodates both frontal and lateral images, rather than just a single view, would be more robust to\\ndifferent imaging studies and could improve vertebral fracture detection.\\n\\nEvaluation\\n\\nWe explored the value of using both frontal and lateral images to automatically identify chest x-rays with vertebral fractures,\\nwedging and compression. EfficientNet-B4 networks were trained on frontal or lateral x-rays to differentiate images with and\\nwithout these vertebral injuries. 7022 frontal (1126 positive) and 4175 lateral (1080 positive) images were used for training.\\nPerformance was evaluated on 2961 exams (495 positive; with 2834 frontals and 1664 laterals). We compared the performance of\\neach model and their combination under various ensemble paradigms, including training an auxiliary network to combine outputs.\\nAUCs of 0.838 and 0.833 were achieved by the frontal and lateral models, respectively. An optimal AUC = 0.882 was achieved with\\nas ensemble using a weighted average of frontal and lateral outputs (0.33 and 0.66 weights) for exams with both images, and the\\navailable model output otherwise.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThe results demonstrate the value of using both frontal and lateral x-rays to substantially improve vertebral fractures detection,\\ndespite favourability toward using lateral images in practice and literature. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to\\ndemonstrate the value of considering multiple x-rays views concurrently for this application.\\n\\nSSIN01-03 Data-Distributed Deep Learning using Federated Learning: A Case Study\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Medical Student\\n\\nParticipants\\nKarthik V.

This outcome enables future work using non-pooled datasets to enhance\\nmodel transportability and clinical utility.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nOne challenge in translating deep learning models to the clinic is a lack of generalizability across institutions, due to poor availability\\nof multi-institutional datasets. The creation of such datasets is often limited by data governance limitations as well as patient\\nprivacy and other ethical concerns. As such, it is desirable to enable the training of such models across institutions without sharing\\nthe underlying data (i.e., \\'data-distributed learning\\'). Here, we present a case study on the use of federated learning (FL), a data-\\ndistributed learning methodology.\\n\\nEvaluation\\n\\n343 T2-weighted images were retrieved from the ProstateX Challenge dataset and annotated with prostate contours. 43 images\\nwere reserved as a held-out test set.Two models were trained using a pooled data (PD) or data-distributed FL approach. For all\\nexperiments, the 3D AH-NET was used as the deep learning model, the soft Dice loss was used with the Adam optimizer, and the\\nevaluation metric was the Dice criterion.For the benchmark PD model, 300 cases were split into 240 training cases and 60 validation\\nand trained for 300 epochs. A mean Dice score of 0.911 on the held-out test set was obtained from evaluation.For the experimental\\nFL model, 300 cases were split into three subsets of 100 cases and distributed to each of our three institutions and similarly split\\ninto training and validation sets. Each institution then trained the model for 300 epochs, and after each epoch the model weights\\nwere collected, averaged, and then redistributed to each institution for use in the next epoch.After 300 training epochs, each\\ninstitution\\'s model was then used to predict segmentations for the held-out test set, resulting in mean Dice scores of 0.909, 0.905,\\nand 0.910.\\n\\n\\x0cDiscussion\\n\\nOur results showed equivalent performance from both the experimental FL (0.908) and benchmark PD models (0.911). This indicates\\nthe FL approach sufficiently enabled learning from the whole dataset without the need to transfer data between institutions.\\n\\nSSIN01-04 Evaluating Automated Approaches for Classifying Stroke Onset Time\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Resident\\n\\nParticipants\\nJennifer Polson, MS, Los Angeles, CA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nHaoyue Zhang, MENG, Los Angeles, CA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nKambiz Nael, MD, Los Angeles, CA (Abstract Co-Author) Medical Advisory Board, Canon Medical Systems Corporation\\nNoriko Salamon, MD, Los Angeles, CA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nBryan Y.

Arnold, Los Angeles, CA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nUsing imaging-based approaches to determine TSS may identify a new population of patients eligible for stroke treatments. Our\\nanalysis represents a robust approach for evaluating multiple automated and radiologist-dependent methods on a single dataset.\\nMoreover, the significantly higher sensitivity of the DL model means that this approach could increase the number of patients\\neligible for thrombolysis.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nStroke is the fifth-leading cause of death in the United States. Interventions that focus on reperfusion of ischemic areas, i.e.\\nthrombolysis, are only available to patients with a known time since stroke (TSS) up to 4.5 hours, but up to 27% of patients are\\nineligible due to unknown TSS. Research has sought to estimate TSS using imaging. Radiologists use diffusion-weighted imaging\\n(DWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) to assess signal mismatching regions representing ischemic, not yet\\ninfarcted, brain regions. In parallel, automated image analysis may be able to classify TSS, which could allow more patients to\\nreceive thrombolytic therapies.\\n\\nEvaluation\\n\\nUsing diffusion MRI from 411 patients, we evaluate our deep learning (DL) model, a slicewise convolutional network, to classify TSS\\nwithin 4.5 hours. We compare the performance of two other methods: radiologist assessment of DWI-FLAIR mismatch, and a\\nmachine learning (ML) approach that extracts radiomic features from a region of interest. For the ML and DL, we report\\nbootstrapped confidence intervals for sensitivity and specificity.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThree board-certified neuroradiologists\\' assessments, based on majority vote, yielded a sensitivity of 0.47, a specificity of 0.89,\\nand a Fleiss\\' kappa of 0.46. Both the ML and DL methods had significantly higher sensitivities than the radiologists (0.69 ± 0.04 and\\n0.78 ± 0.05, respectively); the DL model was able to correctly identify 18% more eligible patients than the radiologist readings. The\\nML pipeline was limited in that its preprocessing excluded over half of the patients from analysis; the DL model was able to evaluate\\nall subjects in the dataset. Visualization of DL model gradient activations provided insight into image regions most informative to the\\nmodel\\'s classification.\\n\\nSSIN01-05 Fully Automatic Detection and Scoring of Kidney Stones on Noncontrast CT Images Using S.T.O.N.E\\n\\nNephrolithometry: Deep Learning-Based Algorithms\\n\\nParticipants\\nYingpu Cui, Beijing, China (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nZhaonan Sun, Beijing, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nXiaodong Zhang, MD, PhD, Beijing, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nXiaoying Wang, MD, Beijing, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\ncui_yingpu@163.com\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo develop and validate cascaded deep learning algorithms for automatic kidney stone detection and scoring on noncontrast\\ncomputed tomography (NCCT) images according to S.T.O.N.E nephrolithometry.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nAbdominal NCCT images were retrospectively archived from February 2018 to April 2019 for three parts: a dataset for kidney and\\nrenal sinus segmentation (n=167), a dataset for hydronephrosis classification (n=282) and a test dataset for S.T.O.N.E scoring\\n(n=117). The algorithms consisted of four steps. First, a 3D U-Net model for kidney and renal sinus segmentation was developed.\\nSecond, Deep 3D Dual-Path Nets for hydronephrosis grading was developed. Third, the thresholding method was used to detect and\\nsegment stones in the renal sinus region. Stone size, CT attenuation and tract length were calculated from the segmented stone\\nregion. Fourth, the stone\\'s location was determined in the renal sinus region. The performance of stone detection was estimated\\nwith sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV). The performance of hydronephrosis grading and stone size, tract length,\\nnumber of involved calyces, essence grading were estimated with areas under the curve (AUC) and linear-weighted κ statistics,\\nrespectively.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe stone detection model reached a sensitivity of 96.3% (236/245) and a PPV of 98.7% (236/239). The hydronephrosis\\nclassification model reached AUC of 0.97.

More than 30,000 unique images\\nfrom sites in US, Ireland and Sweden covering 31 anatomy/view combinations were used to train the model. During training, an\\nimage and a class were randomly selected, and each image was adjusted according to the class selected. The model achieved an\\naverage accuracy of 99.2% when tested on an independent test set of 2700 images. The AI BC algorithm uses the model to adjust\\nimages to achieve a reference class and then to adjust brightness and contrast to achieve the desired look. Evaluation on 3770\\nimages demonstrated 99.1% success rate in reaching the reference look.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThe improvement in brightness and contrast consistency was evaluated in two ways: First, quantitative analysis on a set of 12\\nwrist images with ROIs placed on raw radiation, tissue and bone showed a 53% reduction in mean pixel intensity variation and a\\n39% reduction in bone-tissue contrast variation. Second, a study in which 3 application specialists were asked to adjust brightness\\nand contrast to achieve consistent presentation was performed. Two sets of images (with and without AI BC), each with 30 images\\ncovering 3 anatomies (foot, abdomen and knee) were used. On average, the application specialists took ~20 mins to adjust the\\nimages for the non-AI BC set, whereas they took ~10 mins for the AI BC set.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSIN05\\n\\nInformatics (Artificial Intelligence: Novel approaches Beyond Images)\\n\\nSaturday, Dec. 5 10:00AM - 11:00AM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nCH CT MR BQ AI\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .75\\n\\nFDA  Discussions may include off-label uses.\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSIN05-01 Comparison of State-of-the-Art Transformer-Based Deep Learning Algorithms for Multilabel\\n\\nRadiology Report Text Classification\\n\\nParticipants\\nBrian A.

However, their utility in radiology text\\nclassification has not been well-established. The purpose of this study was to compare several state-of-the-art transformer-based\\ndeep learning algorithms for multilabel chest radiograph (CXR) report classification.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nWe obtained 3,937 radiology reports from the publicly available Indiana University CXR dataset. These reports were parsed in XML\\nformat using Python and the BeautifulSoup4 library to extract 16 manually coded MeSH/RadLex labels associated with each report\\'s\\nfindings. In total, 16 labels were extracted for NLP classification (Table 1) and 1,366 (34.7%) reports were labeled as normal. The\\ndataset was split into training/testing split of 90%/10% and used to train and evaluate 6 state-of-the-art transformer-based NLP\\nmodels to perform 16-label classification: BERT, RoBERTa, distilBERT, distilRoBERTa, XLNet, and ALBERT. Performance was measured\\nusing area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and label ranking average precision (LRAP) based on threshold of\\n0.5.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe RoBERTa model had the highest AUC of 0.990 whereas the DistilRoBERTa model had the highest LRAP of 0.987. The remainder\\nof the models performed similarly with AUC and LRAP scores ranging from 0.975-0.990 and 0.973-0.987, respectively (Figure 1).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nState-of-the-art transformer-based deep learning NLP models demonstrate high accuracy on a multilabel CXR report classification\\ntask, despite using a small dataset. These results suggest that accurate NLP systems can be developed even in the absence of\\nlarge text corpora.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nState-of-the-art transformer-based deep learning NLP models can accurately classify multiple labels from chest radiograph reports\\neven with modest dataset sizes.\\n\\nSSIN05-02 Retrospective Evaluation of Artificial Intelligence Leveraging Free Text Order Entry to Facilitate\\n\\nFederally-Required Clinical Decision Support (CDS)\\n\\nParticipants\\nAmy L.

Provider acceptance is a challenge as some prefer free text order\\nentry over searching lists of structured indications. Our purpose was to evaluate the performance of commercially available artificial\\nintelligence (AI) leveraging free text order entry to facilitate provider selection of structured indications.\\n\\n\\x0cMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nOur health system has used a qCDSM (ACR Select/CareSelect Imaging) since 2014, integrated with our EHR (Epic). In Feb 2020, we\\nimplemented the qCDSM vendor\\'s new AI facilitating selection of structured indications based upon the ordering provider\\'s entry of\\nfree text reason for exam in the context of other EHR data. Providers could order via direct search for structured indications or take\\nthe new free text/AI approach. AI presented several featured indications predicted as likely matches, and additional less likely\\nindications. Providers could select predicted indication(s), perform additional search, indicate there\\'s no match, or exit. We\\nhypothesized the free text approach would be elected more often and the AI would be successful in facilitating selection. We\\nreviewed advanced imaging orders n=22,516 since AI implementation (Feb-Apr). This QI effort absent PHI did not require IRB\\napproval.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nProviders more often chose the free text/AI approach 15,671 (69.6%) over direct search for structured indications 6,845 (30.4%)\\nat order entry. Free text/AI approach yielded alerts with predicted indications in 14,387 (91.8%). Of these, providers chose: AI\\nfeatured indication 7,029 (48.9%), AI additional indication 349 (2.4%), to add direct search 892 (6.2%), to indicate no satisfactory\\nmatch 2750 (19.1%), to exit workflow 3,061 (21.3%). There were 306 (2.1%) logging errors. Of 892 free text/AI approaches where\\nproviders added direct searches, providers returned to select initial AI predicted indications in another 476 (53.4%).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nProviders more often elected the free text/AI approach, suggesting provider preference over direct searching. The AI commonly\\npredicted indications acceptable to ordering providers.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nCommercially available AI can facilitate capture of structured indications needed to meet federal requirements for clinical decision\\nsupport at imaging order entry.\\n\\nSSIN05-03 Personalized Computed Tomography - Automated Estimation of Height and Weight by Simulation of a\\n\\nDigital Twin Using a 3d Camera and Artificial Intelligence\\n\\nParticipants\\nMatthias S.

Reference values\\nwere obtained using a calibrated scale and a measuring tape to train a machine learning algorithm that fits a patient avatar into the\\nrecorded patient surface data. The resulting algorithm was prospectively used on 101 patients in clinical practice and the results\\nwere compared to the reference values and to estimations from the patient himself, from the radiographer and from the radiologist.\\nThe body mass index was calculated from the collected values for each patient using the WHO formula. A tolerance level of 5 kg\\nwas defined in order to evaluate the impact on weight dependent contrast agent dosage in abdominal CT.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nDifferences between values for height, weight and BMI were non-significant over all assessments (p > 0.99). The most accurate\\nvalues for weight were obtained from the patient information (R² = 0.99) followed by the automated estimation via 3D camera (R² =\\n0.89). Estimates by medical staff were considerably less precise (radiologist: R² = 0.78, radiographer: R² = 0.77). A body-weight\\ndependent dosage of contrast agent using the automated estimations matched the dosage using the reference measurements in\\n65% of the cases. The dosage based on the medical staff estimation would have matched in 49% of the cases.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nAutomated estimation of height and weight using digital twin model from 3D camera acquisitions provide a high precision for protocol\\ndesign in computer tomography.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nHeight and weight calculated from digital twins are comparable to real measurements of the patients and can be used for\\ncalculation of contrast agent dosage.\\n\\nSSIN05-04 Use of a Novel Dual Artificial Intelligence (AI) Platform to Detect Unreported Lung Nodules While\\n\\nAvoiding Unnecessary Alerts\\n\\nParticipants\\nAndrew Yen, MD, La Jolla, CA (Abstract Co-Author) Consultant, IMedis AI\\nYitzi Pfeffer, BS, Raanana, Israel (Abstract Co-Author) Stockholder, Imedis AI\\nAviel Blumenfeld, Raanana, Israel (Abstract Co-Author) Stockholder, Imedis AI\\nJonathan N.

Reviewing alerts generated by the Dual-AI Platform would occupy only 1-2 minutes per day. The benefit of\\ncatching an unreported nodule with malignant potential should justify this minimal workflow disruption.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nPulmonary nodules may be precursors to malignancy and are routinely missed on computed tomography (CT). Computer-aided\\ndetection (CAD) assists with nodule detection, but repeated notifications lead to alert fatigue. A novel Dual-AI Platform detects\\nnodules >=6mm by a Computer-Vision (CV) algorithm and filters the positive results by a Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis\\nof the dictated report, only alerting the radiologist to unreported nodules, thereby decreasing alert frequency.\\n\\nEvaluation\\n\\nThe Dual-AI Platform was applied retrospectively to 5,047 chest CTs and their corresponding reports. The CV algorithm detected\\nnodules >=6mm in 1,830 (36.3%) cases. Of these, 355 were unreported per the NLP algorithm. Two chest radiologists determined\\nthat 139 of the 355 were truly unreported. 130 were deemed unnecessary alerts because of vague language in the report\\nconfounding the NLP algorithm. The remaining 86 comprised an absence of nodules, non-nodules (e.g. scar), and nodules < 6mm.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThe Dual-AI Platform detected unreported nodules in 2.8% of cases, an 8.7% (139/1,605) increase in nodule detection. It\\nprevented 81% (1,475/1,830) of alerts that would have been unnecessary. For a radiologist reading 50 chest CTs per day, a 7.0%\\n(355/5,047) alert rate and a 2.8% (139/5,047) true-positive rate correspond to 3-4 potential alerts, with 1-2 representing genuine\\nmissed actionable findings.\\n\\nSSIN05-05 Empowering Patients to Participate in Care: Practical Implementation of Natural Language Generation\\n\\n(NLG) for Real-Time Creation of Patient-Accessible Documents While Producing Conventional\\nRadiology Reports\\n\\nParticipants\\nMichael A.

These reports are not designed for the patient audience and can\\ncause patients undue emotional distress and misunderstanding. NLG can provide multiple report outputs while automatically\\nincorporating accepted clinical guidelines without adding burden to the radiologist.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nLack of comprehension of medical image reporting jargon (both semantics and syntax) is a critical barrier to patient understanding\\nand engagement in their own care. This lack of clarity may inadvertently give patients an incorrect impression of their findings or\\ndiagnosis, and creates risk due to the communication gap between patients and radiologists. This may also contribute to loss of\\nsatisfying patient-physician relationships which is reported to be a source of job alienation and burnout for radiologists. We present\\nthe utilization of NLG technology as a first step to reconcile this problem while being cognizant of real-world constraints and\\nobjectives. NLG is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that translates data into linguistic data stories.\\n\\nEvaluation\\n\\nFirst-trimester US reporting is evaluated as a use case, such as normal early pregnancy, early pregnancy unknown viability, early\\npregnancy suspicious for fetal demise, early pregnancy diagnostic for fetal demise, and early pregnancy suspicious for ectopic. US\\nfindings and measurements are deconstructed into a collection of independent discrete variables. Variables are stored in a database\\nunique to the clinical use case in a method that facilitates comparison of current with prior results. Arria Studio was utilized for\\ncustom scripting to develop NLG outputs while adjudicating conditionals.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThe paradigm of separating \"finding-recording\" from \"report-presentation\" results in reports tailored for separate patient and\\nphysician audiences from the same radiologist work-unit according to ACR-ACOG guidelines.\\n\\n\\x0cSSIN05-06 Investigation of Using Deep Learning to Predict Patient Eye-Lens Dose During Neuro-interventional\\n\\nProcedures\\n\\nParticipants\\nJacob Collins, Buffalo, NY (Presenter) Researcher, Canon Medical Systems Corporation\\nChao Guo, MS, Amherst, NY (Abstract Co-Author) Research support, Canon Medical Systems Corporation\\nAlexander R.

An estimation of lens dose can be obtained using Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation for each exposure projection but MC\\ncannot provide real-time feedback to the interventionalist. To obtain real-time update, deep learning (DL) models were investigated\\nas a means to estimate the patient lens dose for the given exposure conditions.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nMonte Carlo simulations were done using a Zubal computational phantom to produce a dataset of eye lens dose values that was\\nused to train various DL models. The simulations were performed with variation of six geometric parameters: entrance field size, LAO\\ngantry angulation, patient x, y, z head position relative to the beam isocenter, and whether right or left eye. The dose for each\\ncombination of parameters was expressed as lens dose per entrance air kerma (mGy/Gy)). Portions of the dataset were used for\\ntesting and the rest were used for validation and training of the models. Model performance was evaluated using the metrics of\\nmean absolute percentage error (MAPE).\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nSeveral different DL models were tested using various configurations of dense layers, activation functions and other factors. The\\nbest model found was a combination of eLU models derived from k-fold cross validation methods. The combined model has each k-\\nfold model make a prediction, and then takes the median of their predictions to generate one final prediction. Using this combined\\nmodel method led to lower overall error (MAPE < 8%) and more accurate predictions compared to a single model. Furthermore,\\nprediction time for the combined model was about 30 ms, while MC simulation time was in the range of hours.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nA DL model is able to accurately infer the lens dose for a set of given geometric exposure parameters. This work shows that deep\\nlearning is a viable option for lens dose estimation for fluoroscopically-guided neuro-interventional procedures and could eliminate\\nthe need for a vast database of pre-calculated factors for each specific exposure condition in a real-time dose feedback system.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThe lens of the eye is at risk for cataractogenesis during neuro-interventional procedures. Real-time display of lens dose made\\npossible through deep learning can facilitate informed dose management.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSMI01\\n\\nMolecular Imaging (Oncology - Diagnostics and Therapeutics)\\n\\nTuesday, Dec. 1 2:00PM - 3:00PM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nGI MR OI BQ\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .75\\n\\nFDA  Discussions may include off-label uses.\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSMI01-01 89Zr-Labeled PD-L1 PET Imaging as a Potential Biomarker to Replace Immunohistochemistry (IHC)\\n\\nParticipants\\nHuijie Jiang, PhD, MS, Harbin, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nSheng Zhao, MD, Harbin, China (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nWenbin Pan, MD, Harbin, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nRongjun Zhang, MA, Wuxi, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\njhjemail@163.com\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nUp-regulation of tumor PD-L1 expression can lead to a poor prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The clinical outcome of\\nPD-L1 therapy is related to the expression level of PD-L1. IHC is invasive and only reflects the expression of PD-L1 in a tiny fraction\\nof a tumor. Hence, we developed a 89Zr labeled Atezolizumab as a probe (89Zr - Df- Atz), using xenograft mice to detect whether\\nthe PET imaging can reflect tumor PD-L1 expression.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nWe used Df-Bz-NCS to premodified with Atezolizumab, and then incubated with 89Zr-oxalate in HEPES buffer for 60min, purified by\\nPD-10 column, the radiochemical purity(RCP) was measured by HPLC. 89Zr -Atz was incubated in human serum and PBS at different\\ntemperatures for 24-120h to test the stability in vitro. The same concentration of 89Zr-Df-Atz was incubated with different\\nconcentrations of CRC PD-L1 high expression cells RKO. According to the Limdo method, the immunoreactive score(IRS) was fitted.\\nBALB/c nu/nu mice were subcutaneously implanted with CRC cells (HT29, HCT116, and RKO) with different expression levels of PD-\\nL1, then xenograft mice were intravenously injected with an appropriate amount of 89Zr-Df-Atz 21 days later, some were\\neuthanized within 48-120h to determine the biodistribution of organs and tumor, other mice were scanned PET imaging, and the\\nradioactivity parameters were analyzed\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nStability study showed that RCP was greater than 95% when 89Zr-Df-Atz was stored in 4 °C serum for 120h or 37°C serum for 48h.\\nThe fitted IRS was 88.34%, indicating that 89Zr-Df-Atz could effectively bind to tumor PD-L1, and the labeling reaction did not\\nimpair its antigen-binding ability. The biodistribution showed that liver uptake is highest in normal tissues, and the tumor-muscle\\nratio reached its highest point at 120h.PET imaging showed the tumor to muscle(legs) SUVmax ratio can effectively distinguish\\nbetween PD-L1 high and low expression tumors(p<0.001).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n89Zr-Df-Atz allowed efficient and simple to prepare and better stability can help to further explore the various stages of colorectal\\ncancer, which is expected to become an imaging tool to replace IHC.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\n89Zr-Df-Atz\\'s advantages herald its value for further human research, and it is expected to replace immunohistochemistry as the\\nbasis for stratification of immunotherapy patients.\\n\\nSSMI01-02 Application Value of PET/MR Radiomics Features and Metabolic Parameters in Evaluating the Staging\\n\\nof Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Resident\\n\\nParticipants\\nJiangtao Liang, BS,BS, Hangzhou, China (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nhzliangjt@163.com\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo investigate the value of PET/MR radiomics features and metabolic parameters in evaluating the TNM staging of nasopharyngeal\\ncarcinoma (NPC).\\n\\n\\x0cMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThe PET/MR imaging data of 100 NPC patients from a medical center were collected. The patients were randomly divided into\\ntraining group (n = 70) and test group (n = 30). The pathological and clinical diagnosis results were used as the gold standard for\\ndiagnosis. We measured the metabolic parameters (SUVmax, MTV, TLG) of the NPC primary focus, and used AK software to extract\\nthe most relevant radiomics features to NPC staging. To compare the differences of the parameters and features of different\\nstages, and evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of statistically significant parameters and features through the ROC curve in NPC\\nstaging.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nWe extracted 6 and 3 radiomics features most relevant to the staging of NPC from T2WI and PET images, respectively. The AUCs of\\nthe training and test group were 0.849 and 0.833 in the T2WI model, while they were 0.840 and 0.815 in the PET model. The MTV,\\nTLG, T2WI radiomics feature (MinIntensity) and PET radiomics feature (GLCMEntropy_angle0_offset4) had statistically significant\\ndifferences between and within groups of T stages (P < 0.05). With the increase of T stage, the mean value of MinIntensity\\ndecreased gradually, while the others increased gradually. The four had higher diagnostic efficiency in differentiating T-\\nstage(AUC:0.785-0.956). The TLG and PET radiomics feature (GLCMEntropy_angle0_offset4) had statistically significant differences\\nbetween and within groups in clinical stages (P <0.01). With the increase of clinical staging, the mean value of the two gradually\\nincreased, and they had higher diagnostic efficacy in differentiating clinical stage (AUC:0.775-0.953). The comparison between\\ngroups showed that the T2WI radiomics feature (GLCMEntropy_AllDirection_offset1_SD) was smaller in the patients with lymph node\\nmetastasis (P <0.05).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nPET/MR radiomics features and metabolic parameters were of great value in evaluating T-stage and clinical stage of NPC, but they\\nhad limited value in N-stage. In the future, radiomics features are expected to be a more economical tool for predicting the staging\\nof NPC.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nPET / MR examination can be performed when the local invasion and distant metastasis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma need be\\nunderstood at the same time.\\n\\nSSMI01-03 Imaging Early HER3-Driven Response to Pan-Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibition Therapy in Gastric\\n\\nCancer\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Fellow\\n\\nParticipants\\nShadi Abdar Esfahani, MD,MPH, Boston, MA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nPedram Heidari, MD, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nCarolina De Aguiar Ferreira, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nUmar Mahmood, MD,PhD, Winchester, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Co-founder, CytoSite Biopharma; Shareholder, CytoSite Biopharma;\\nConsultant, CytoSite Biopharma; Grant, CytoSite Biopharma; ; ; \\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nesfahani.shadi@mgh.harvard.edu\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo evaluate the use of HER3 PET/MRI for prediction of gastric cancer (GCa) response to afatinib, a pan-receptor tyrosine kinase\\ninhibitor (RTKI), shortly after treatment initiation.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nA panel of GCa cell lines was assessed for baseline level of total and phosphorylated RTKs including EGFR, HER2, HER3 and their\\ndownstream signaling nodes. Cell viability was assessed in 0-72 hrs of treatment with 0.01-1 µM Afatinib. HER3-expressing afatinib-\\nsensitive (NCI-N87) and afatinib-resistant (SNU16) cells were selected for comparing quantitative changes in RTKs and downstream\\nnodes 0-72 hrs after treatment with afatinib. Murine xenograft models of NCI-N87 and SNU16 GCa were developed (n=20 nude\\nmice/group). PET/MRI with HER3 targeting peptide,68Ga-HER3P1, was performed before and 3 days after treatment with Afatinib 10\\nmg/kg, or vehicle PO Daily (n=10/group). Temporal changes in HER3 PET uptake (SUVmax and SUVmean) between baseline and day\\n3 were correlated with HER3 changes in tumor tissue by immunofluorescence microscopy. Tumor growth curves of control and\\ntreated groups were compared over 3 weeks. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nTreatment with afatinib 100nM resulted in significantly increased total HER3 expression in NCI-N87 cells and reduction of pHER3 and\\nall other RTKs and downstream nodes over 72 hrs, while a complete opposite profile was observed in SNU16 cells (total HER3 at 72\\nh afatinib / baseline: 3.7 ± 0.22 vs. 0.48 ± 0.72 in NCI-N87 vs. SNU16, p<0.001). 68Ga-HER3P1 PET/MRI in NCI-N87 tumors showed\\nsignificantly increased SUVmean on day 3 of treatment compared to baseline, and no significant uptake change in resistant SNU16\\ntumors (SUVmean in Day0 v.s Day3: 1.6 ± 0.56 vs. 3.85 ± 0.69, p<0.05 in NCI-N87, 1.72 ± 0.73 vs. 1.5 ± 0.69, p=0.09 in SNU16).\\nHER3 expression changes were confirmed with immunofluorescence microscopy of tumor tissues. Tumors growth trajectory over 3\\nweeks was concordant with PET and histopathology results (tumor volume in treated vs. control: 11.2 ± 16.6 mm3 vs. 293 ± 79.35\\nmm3, p<0.05 in NCI-N87, 178.3 ± 91.2 mm3 vs. 281.9 ± 34.9 mm3, p=0.2 in SNU16).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nHER3 PET imaging detects rapid quantitative changes of HER3 expression and predicts response to RTKI therapy in GCa.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nHER3 PET imaging could predict response to pan-RTK inhibitors within few days after initiation of treatment and help with early\\nmanagement plans.\\n\\nSSMI01-04 Optical Imaging of Radiofrequency Hyperthermia-Enhanced Oncolytic Therapy for Hepatic Cancer\\n\\n\\x0cParticipants\\nGuanhui Zhou, MD, Seattle, WA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nXuefeng Kan, MD,PhD, Seattle, WA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJunhui Sun, MD,PhD, Hangzhou, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nFeng Zhang, MD, Seattle, WA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nXiaoming Yang, MD, PhD, Mercer Island, WA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nxmyang@uw.edu\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo investigate the feasibility using indocyanine green (ICG)-based optical imaging (OI) to assess efficacy of radiofrequency\\nhyperthermia (RFH)-enhanced oncolytic therapy for hepatic cancer.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThis study included (1) optimizing ICG dose for intracellular uptake by rat hepatic cancer cells (MCA-RH7777); (2) optimizing ICG\\ntime-window for ICG-enhanced OI; and (3) validating the feasibility using ICG-based OI to assess efficacy of RFH-enhanced\\noncolytic therapy (LTX-315) for treatment of same cancers. In optimizing ICG dose and time-window, tumor cells were treated with\\nvarious ICG concentrations (0 to 200 μg/mL) and different incubation times (0 min to 48 h). The half maximal inhibitory\\nconcentration (IC50) of LTX-315 was quantified by MTS assay. ICG-cells were divided into four study groups (n=6/group) with\\ndifferent treatments: (1) RFH alone at 42°C for 30?min; (2) oncolytic therapy with LTX-315; (3) combination therapy of RFH+LTX-\\n315; and (4) saline. MTS assay, fluorescence microscopy, and flow cytometry were used to compare cell viabilities and apoptosis.\\nOI of ICG-cells was performed using both Bruker optical/x-ray imaging and an interventional micro-OI needle. The ICG-cell signal\\nintensities (SI) were statistically compared among various cell groups.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nICG taken up by cancer cells was linearly increased from 0 to 100 μg/mL with the optimized concentration at 100 μg/mL, while ICG-\\nSI reached the peak at 24 hours. IC50 of LTX-315 was 25.4 μM. MTS assay and apoptosis analysis demonstrated the lowest cell\\nviability and highest apoptosis in combination therapy, compared to other three groups (p<0.001). ICG-enhanced interventional OI\\nshowed a significantly decreased SI in combination therapy, which was confirmed by the \"standard\" optical/x-ray imaging (Figure).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThis study demonstrates the feasibility of ICG-based OI to assess efficacy of RFH-enhanced oncolytic therapy for hepatic cancers,\\nwhich may open a new avenue to further develop a new intraoperative OI technique, to instantly guide complete tumor kill at the\\nablated tumor margin, a current clinical problem of persistence post-ablation of medium-to-large tumors.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThis study has established ground works to further develop an intraoperative real-time optical imaging technique, to instantly\\nassess complete ablation of medium-to-large tumors.\\n\\nSSMI01-05 Fluciclovine Detection of Primary Prostate Cancer at the Sextant Level and Correlation of SUVmax\\n\\nwith Gleason Grades\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Resident\\n\\nParticipants\\nJed J.

Prior to prostatectomy the patients were evaluated with fluciclovine PET/CT imaging and each prostate\\nlesion was radiographically identified. Furthermore, the SUVmax uptake parameter from each prostate sextant was recorded.\\nFollowing each prostatectomy, the entire prostate was submitted for sextant-to-sextant pathological Gleason grading. Imaging from\\nthe fluciclovine PET/CT was compared against the post-surgical pathology results of each prostate. Every tumor containing\\nprostate sextant was given a post-surgical Gleason grade. ANOVA statistical method was used to determine correlation between\\nprostate sextant fluciclovine SUVmax and pathological Gleason grade. Sextants with less than 10% tumor volume per path analysis\\nwere excluded from analysis.\\n\\n\\x0cRESULTS\\n\\nFluciclovine was able to predict the presence of prostate tumor per post-surgical pathological sextant analysis with 85% sensitivity,\\n81% specificity, 95% PPV, and 54% NPV. Prostate sextants with higher Gleason grades demonstrated a higher mean SUVmax.\\nFurthermore, ANOVA analysis demonstrated statistical significance (p >0.001) between Gleason grade SUVmax means. However,\\nthe SUVmax per Gleason grade demonstrated a high degree of variability.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nFluciclovine is able to detect the presence of primary prostate cancer with accurate localization to the sextant level making\\nfluciclovine PET/CT a valuable pre-surgical planning tool. Furthermore, fluciclovine SUVmax values correlate significantly with\\nGleason grade groups of primary tumors.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nOur research demonstrates a corrleation between Fluciclovine SUVmax and post-surgical primary prostate cancer gleason grade.\\nGiven that our current gold standard methods in primary prostate cancer diagnosis and grading are unreliable and often\\nunderestimate true post surgical tumor grade, fluciclovine PET/CT will be a useful analytic tool in assuring proper tumor grading in\\nthe pre-surgical planning phase.\\n\\nSSMI01-06 Overall Survival After 177Lu-PSMA-617 Molecular Radiotherapy in Patients with Metastatic Castrate-\\n\\nresistant Prostate Cancer: Post-hoc Analysis of a Prospective Phase II Trial\\n\\nParticipants\\nJeremie Calais, MD, Los Angeles, CA (Presenter) Consultant, RadioMedix, IncConsultant, Blue Earth Diagnostics LtdConsultant,\\nProgenics Pharmaceuticals, IncConsultant, Johnson & JohnsonConsultant, Curium SASConsultant, General Electric Company\\nWesley R.

The study was\\ninvestigator-initiated under an investigational new drug approval protocol (IND#133661) with authorization of charging for\\ninvestigational drug (cost-recovery, Title 21 CFR 312.8). We report here the post-hoc analysis of overall survival (OS) in a single-\\nstudy site cohort (UCLA).\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nPatients with progressive mCRPC (biochemical, radiographic, or clinical) after >=1 novel androgen axis drug, either chemotherapy\\n(CTX) naïve or post-CTX, with sufficient bone marrow reserve, normal kidney function, and sufficient PSMA-target expression by\\nPET were eligible. Patients received up to 4 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617 every 8±1 weeks and were randomized into 2 treatment\\nactivities groups (6.0 or 7.4 GBq). Efficacy was defined as serum PSA decline of >=50% from baseline and served as primary\\nendpoint (hypothesis: >=40% of responders after 2 cycles).\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\n43 patients were randomized to the 6.0GBq (n= 14) and 7.4GBq (n=29) treatment arms. 11/43 (26%) were CTX naïve while 10/43\\n(23%), 12/43 (28%), 5/43 (12%) and 5/43 (12%) had received 1, 2, 3 or 4 CTX regimens. Median baseline PSA was 29.2 ng/ml\\n(mean 228.8, range 0.5-2082.6). 21/43 (49%) completed 4 cycles of 177Lu-PSMA-617 whereas 4/43 (9%), 13/43 (30%) and 5/43\\n(12%) underwent 1, 2 and 3 cycles.

The average patient age was 40 years [13, 68] with an average BMI of 26.3kg/m2 [18.2, 41.5]. Clinical\\nindications included pain (n=35), suspected internal derangement of knee (n=28), trauma (n=23), and evaluation of post-operative\\nchanges (n=14). In 18 patients, fractures were diagnosed. Three radiologists rated confidence in evaluating osseous abnormalities\\nas well as image quality (e.g. artifacts, contrast) on a 5-grade Likert scale. In a subset of knees (n=57) SPGR sequences were also\\nobtained, and diagnostic confidence in identifying osseous abnormalities was assessed, comparing ZTE and SPGR sequences. To\\nobtain CT-like contrast, the grey values of both sequences were inverted. Significance was characterized with a dependent t-test.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nZTE image quality was overall rated high by all reviewers with 90% scores >= 4 using the Likert scale. The diagnostic confidence in\\nusing ZTE over SPGR for osseous abnormalities was favorable and statistically significant with a mean Likert score of 3.13 for ZTE\\nand 2.59 for SPGR (p-value: 0.017). Diagnostic confidence in using ZTE was rated \\'definitely certain\\' in 97%, 85%, 71% and 73% of\\nthe cases for osteophytosis, subchondral cysts, fractures, and soft tissue calcifications, respectively. In 74% of cases with\\nosseous findings reviewer scores indicated high confidence levels (score >= 4) that ZTE improved diagnostic certainty [versus 58%\\nof the cases without osseous findings]. In 53% of cases with osseous findings reviewers indicated that ZTE would alter patient\\nmanagement [versus 41% of the cases without osseous findings].\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIncorporating ZTE MRI sequences in the standard knee imaging protocol was technically feasible, improved diagnostic confidence\\nfor osseous abnormalities and suggested improved patient management. In comparison to SPGR sequences, ZTE improved\\nassessment of osseous abnormalities.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nBy improving assessment of osseous abnormalities, ZTE, in comparison to CT-like SPGR sequences, was found to be clinically useful\\nand may have an impact on patient management.\\n\\nSSMK02-03 Three-dimensional Quantification of Knee Joint Space Narrowing with Weight-bearing CT:\\n\\nComparison with Non-weight-bearing CT and Weight-bearing Radiography\\n\\nParticipants\\nBenjamin Fritz, MD, Zurich, Switzerland (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nJan Fritz, MD, New York, NY (Abstract Co-Author) Institutional research support, Siemens AGInstitutional research support, Johnson\\n& JohnsonInstitutional research support, Zimmer Biomet Holdings, IncInstitutional research support, Microsoft\\n\\n\\x0cCorporationInstitutional research support, BTG International LtdScientific Advisor, Siemens AGScientific Advisor, General Electric\\nCompanyScientific Advisor, BTG International LtdSpeaker, Siemens AGPatent agreement, Siemens AG\\nSandro F.

All patients underwent supine NWB-CT,\\nupright WB-CT and WB-XR of the knee joint. Using specialized software, 3D analysis of joint space width was performed by\\nquantifying the minimal distance of each voxel of the medial and lateral tibial surface to the femoral condyles on WB-CT and NWB-\\nCT. Average and minimal joint space widths of NWB-CT and WB-CT were quantified. Associations with mechanical leg axis were\\nevaluated. Minimal joint space widths were further compared to WB-XR.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe average joint space widths of the medial and lateral compartment were significantly different (p=0.028 and p=0.018) between\\nWB-CT (medial: 4.7mm, lateral: 6.3mm) and NWB-CT (medial: 5.1mm, lateral: 6.8mm). On average, the minimal joint space widths\\n(medial: 3.1mm, lateral: 5.8mm) on WB-XR were significantly wider (all p<0.001) when compared to WB-CT (medial: 1.8mm, lateral:\\n2.9mm) and NWB-CT (medial: 1.8mm, lateral: 2.9mm), but not significantly different (all p>=0.869) between WB-CT and NWB-CT.\\nFor patients with varus knee alignment, significant differences of average joint space widths between WB-CT and NWB-CT for the\\nmedial (3.7mm vs 4.7mm, p=0.004) and lateral (6.5mm vs 6.8mm, p=0.028) compartments existed. Also, for varus knee alignment,\\nthe minimal joint space widths were significantly different between WB-CT and NWB-CT for the medial (0.9mm vs 1.5mm, p=0.011)\\nand lateral (2.9mm vs 2.7mm, p=0.01) compartment. On WB-CT, 25% (13/52) of the medial and lateral knee joint spaces showed\\nbone-on-bone apposition, which was significantly higher when compared to NWB-CT (7/52, 13%, p=0.031) and WB-XR (4/52, 8%,\\np=0.012).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nSignificant differences exist for joint space widths between WB-CT, NWB-CT, and WB-XR. The combination of 3D quantification and\\nWB-CT demonstrates significantly more areas of bone-on-bone apposition, which are underestimated or even undetectable on\\nNWB-CT and WB-XR.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThe combination of computer-based 3D quantification and weight-bearing CT affords evaluation of the knee joint space under\\nphysiological conditions, which may serve as a more accurate CT-based biomarker for the assessment of knee cartilage integrity,\\nthereby avoiding understaging of osteoarthritis.\\n\\nSSMK02-04 MRI Appearance of MPFL Reconstructions Requiring Revision Surgery for Instability\\n\\nParticipants\\nTony T.

Exclusion criteria included patients requiring revision MPFL surgery for reasons other than instability (n=3)\\nyielding a study group of 38 patients (22F:16M, mean 20.9 ± 8 years old, range 9-42).Two MSK radiologists assessed in consensus:\\nMPFL graft signal (hypointense, intermediate, hyperintense, or fluid), graft thickness (mm), femoral screw (intact, broken, extruded,\\nbroken and extruded), femoral tunnel osteolysis (mm), and interval patellofemoral cartilage damage (modified Outerbridge) compared\\nto preoperative MRI. A third MSK radiologist measured the tibial tubercle-trochlear groove distance (TT-TG) and Caton-Deschamps\\nindex (CDI). All three radiologists assessed femoral tunnel position blindly and independently with final result determined by majority\\nconsensus.Statistics included chi square, t-test, and kappa.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe anatomic femoral origin of the MPFL is between the adductor tubercle (AT), medial epicondyle (ME), and medial gastrocnemius\\norigin (MG). There were 14/38 (37%) femoral tunnels within this region and 24/38 (63%) outside of this region. There were 7/38\\n(18%) patients that required MPFL revision for instability. All 7 that required revision were out of the anatomic region (p = 0.025)\\n(Figure 1). Intra-reader reliability for femoral tunnel position was moderate to substantial (k = 0.42, 0.74, and 0.78). Inter-reader\\nreliability was substantial (k = 0.62).There was no difference in mean graft thickness, femoral tunnel osteolysis, femoral screw\\n\\n\\x0cintegrity, graft signal, TT-TG, or CDI in patients that required MPFL revision for instability vs. those that did not. None of the\\nexamined imaging or clinical factors predicted the degree or presence of patellofemoral cartilage damage.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nFemoral tunnel position is more predictive of need for MPFL revision than the appearance of the graft on MRI.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThe appearance of an MPFL graft on MRI does not predict its function or integrity. Optimization of femoral tunnel positioning is\\nimportant to maximize chances of graft success.\\n\\nSSMK02-05 Lateral Patella Tilt and its Association with 3T MRI-defined Patellofemoral Osteoarthritis: A\\n\\nLongitudinal Analysis of the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) Cohort\\n\\nParticipants\\nArya Haj-Mirzaian, MD,MPH, Baltimore, MD (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nAli Guermazi, MD,PhD, West Roxbury, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Shareholder, Boston Imaging Core Lab, LLCResearch Consultant,\\nMerck KGaAResearch Consultant, Roche, IncResearch Consultant, TissueGene, IncResearch Consultant, Galapagos, IncResearch\\nConsultant, AstraZeneca PLCResearch Consultant, Pfizer Inc\\nFarhad Pishgar, MD, Baltimore, MD (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nFrank W.

In this\\nstudy, we assessed the cross-sectional/longitudinal association of lateral patella tilt (LPT) measures with OA-related features in PF\\ncompartment.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nRecorded clinical and imaging data of all 600 participants in the FNIH project, a nested case-control study within the OAI cohort\\nwhich is the largest ongoing cohort studying knee OA, were extracted and analyzed. The knee MRI sequences of all subjects were\\nread by two musculoskeletal radiologists to measure LPT (as the angle formed between lines showing the longest patella diameter\\nand posterior aspect of both condyles). Association of LPT measures with MRI OA Knee Scoring (MOAKS) for knee OA-related\\nfeatures, including cartilage damage, bone marrow lesions (BMLs), and osteophytes in addition to knee cartilage volumes at\\nbaseline, and worsening of MOAKS readings and cartilage volumes after 2-year follow-up were assessed in logistic regression models\\nadjusted for several possible confounders (Figure), and reporting odds ratio (OR).\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nIn the cross-sectional part, higher LPT was associated with lower cartilage volumes in lateral tibia, femur, and patella, in addition to\\nhigher scores of surface/thickness cartilage damage (OR=1.05(1.02-1.08) and OR=1.08(1.04-1.11)), number (OR=1.06(1.03-1.09))\\nand size (OR=1.06(1.03-1.09)) of BMLs, and osteophytes (OR=1.07(1.04-1.11)) in lateral PF region. However, medial PF region\\nshowed lower cartilage defects and BMLs scores and higher osteophytes scores in subjects with higher LPT. In the longitudinal\\nstudy, higher LPT measures were also associated with worsening of cartilage volume in lateral tibia and BMLs scores in lateral PF\\nregion.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nHigher measures of LPT is associated with the progression of OA-related features in lateral patella and trochlea (2-11% increase in\\nodds of OA progression for each degree increase in LPT), whereas it was linked with lower odds of cartilage defects and BMLs in\\nmedial trochlea.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nSubjects with higher LPT (patellar tilt) are at increased risk of lateral PFOA incidence and progression.\\n\\nSSMK02-06 A Prospective Randomized Trial of Biologic Augmentation with Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Patients\\n\\nUndergoing Anterior Cruciate Ligament Reconstruction\\n\\nParticipants\\nBrian Forsythe, MD, Chicago, IL (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nOphelie Lavoie-Gagne, San Diego, CA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nWon C.

The purpose of this\\nstudy is to correlate quantitative MR assessment of ACL graft with outcome measures in bone marrow-aspirate concentrate\\n(BMAC), containing mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), on graft ligamentization in patients undergoing ACL reconstruction (ACLR) with\\nbone-patellar tendon-bone (BTB) allografts compared to a control cohort.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nA single blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted where patients received either intra-operative BMAC injection into the\\nallograft or sham incision. Bone marrow aspirate was harvested from the anterior-superior iliac crest, concentrated via centrifuge,\\nand a minimum of 1.25mL injected into proximal, middle, and distal sites of the allograft. T2-weighted MRI was performed at 3 and 9\\nmonths post-operatively and assessed by a musculoskeletal radiologist blinded to treatment group. Regions of interest (ROIs) were\\nplaced at the proximal, middle and distal thirds of the ACL graft and in the patellar tendon. Signal-intensity-ratios (SIRs) were\\ncalculated and compared between the two groups at both time points. Secondary outcomes included range of motion, International\\nKnee Documentation Committee (IKDC) scores, and VR12 Mental Health (VR12) surveys. Analysis consisted of chi-square and\\nindependent t-tests with alpha set at 0.05.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nA total of 43 patients were enrolled with 20 patients receiving BMAC and 23 controls. There were no significant differences in\\ngender, age, or time to injury between groups. Allograft signal intensity and SIR for the inferior third of the allograft was\\nsignificantly higher 3 months postop in the BMAC cohort (17.67 vs 11.83; p=0.013 and 2.73 vs 1.88; p=0.04). At 9 months post-\\noperation, the BMAC cohort outperformed the control cohort in both clinical (flexion 133° vs 128°; p=0.02) and patient-reported\\noutcomes (IKDC 64.2 vs 61.7; p=0.04 and VR12 57.0 vs 54.7; p=0.002).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nQuantitative MR evaluation of ACL grafts at 3 months suggest an accelerated rate of ligamentization in BMAC versus control\\ncohorts reflected by improved clinical and patient-reported outcomes at 9 months.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThe positive results of this pioneer randomized clinical trial of ACL ligamentization following BMAC injection into allograft may guide\\nfuture investigations regarding effectiveness of BMAC biologic augmentation in ACLR.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSMK08\\n\\nMusculoskeletal (Shoulder)\\n\\nThursday, Dec. 3 10:00AM - 11:00AM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nMK MR US\\n\\nAI\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .75\\n\\nFDA  Discussions may include off-label uses.\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSMK08-01 Classification of Rotator Cuff Tears on MR Imaging using a Deep Learning Approach\\n\\nParticipants\\nJia Cheng Yao, BSC, Ottawa, ON (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nLeonid Chepelev, MD,PhD, Ottawa, ON (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nYashmin Nisha, MD, Ottawa, ON (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nPaul Anton Reymond Prakash Sathiadoss, MBBS, Ottawa, ON (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nAdnan M.

Studies were\\nobtained using a balanced random sampling of full-thickness RCT, partial-thickness RCT, and normal shoulder MR studies completed\\nbetween 01/01/2015 to 01/07/2019. Images were obtained on either a 1.5T or 3.0T scanner. Coronal T2 fat-saturated sequences\\nwere preprocessed and used as input to the model (6405 image slices). The model is a deep learning classifier comprised of 3\\nstages: 1) a slice selection network based on a pre-trained ResNet; 2) a segmentation network based on U-Net; and 3) a custom\\nconvolutional neural network for final study classification. Training labels were created based on radiologist reports and were\\nvalidated by consensus read by two musculoskeletal radiologists. Data was split 64:16:20 into training, validation, and test sets\\nusing stratified random sampling. The model was evaluated using a 5-fold cross-validation strategy and tested on a single iteration\\nof the holdout test dataset.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nOn the cross-validation data the sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy of the model in detecting RCTs was 76% (95% CI:\\n65- 85%), 81% (95% CI: 71-89%) and 79% (95% CI: 72-85%). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.86. The model\\ncorrectly identified 37/40 (93%) of full-thickness RCTs and 24/40 (60%) of partial-thickness RCTs. Segmentation accuracy was\\nmoderate with a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.79. On the holdout dataset the sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and AUC\\nwere 88% (95% CI: 62-98%), 75% (95% CI: 48-93%), 81% (95% CI: 64-93%) and 0.90.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe study demonstrated a moderate diagnostic accuracy for the classification of rotator cuff tears using a deep learning approach.\\nImprovements may be expected with a larger training set and future model development.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nA deep learning classifier may be considered to aid radiologists and automatically triage patients undergoing MR imaging for\\nsuspected rotator cuff tears.\\n\\nSSMK08-02 Deep Learning Approach for Segmentation of Rotator Cuff Muscles on MR Images\\n\\nParticipants\\nMartin Torriani, MD, Boston, MA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nGiovanna Medina, MD, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nColleen G.

We hypothesized that a deep CNN approach can\\naccurately perform both tasks compared to similar manual tasks.\\n\\n\\x0cMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nWe created 2 models: Model A for Y-view selection and Model B for muscle segmentation. For Model A, we manually selected\\nshoulder sagittal T1 Y-views from 258 cases as ground truth to train a classification CNN model (Keras/Tensorflow, Inception v3, 16\\nbatch size, 100 epochs, dropout 0.2, initial learning rate 0.001, RMSprop). A top-3 success rate was used to evaluate Model A\\nperformance on 100 test cases. For Model B, we manually segmented sagittal T1 Y-views in 1,048 cases for measuring RC muscle\\nCSA of suprapinatus, infraspinatus, and subscapularis muscles. Model B images (N=943) underwent histogram equalization and data\\naugmentation. Model B was trained from scratch (Keras/Tensorflow, U-Net, 8 batch size, 50 epochs, dropout 0.2, initial learning\\nrate 0.0001, softmax). Dice (F1) score compared similarity between manual vs. CNN-based segmentation on 105 test cases to\\nevaluate Model B performance.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nModel A performance to select an appropriate Y-view showed top-3 accuracy of 98%. Model B for RC muscle segmentation showed\\noverall mean Dice score of 95%. Individual Dice scores for each muscle were: background 99%, supraspinatus 93%, infraspinatus\\n94%, and subscapularis 93%. Inspection of test case segmentations showed [a] prevalence of errors at caudal margins of\\nsubscapularis muscle, likely reflecting variable field-of-view in training images; and [b] prediction errors at fascial/adipose\\ninterdigitations, especially subscapularis and infraspinatus.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nOur results show overall accurate Y-view selection and automated RC muscle segmentation using a combination of deep CNN\\nalgorithms. Accuracy was generally high and improvement of algorithm performance will focus on strategies addressing areas of\\ncommon prediction errors. This workflow may serve as a basis for future models aimed at automated segmentation of rotator cuff\\nmusculature.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nUse of an automated, repeatable and prompt method to quantify RC muscle CSA is critical for clinical and surgical decision-making\\nin shoulder orthopedics.\\n\\nSSMK08-03 Newly Developed Deep Learning Reconstruction: Capability for Image Quality Improvement of MRI\\n\\nObtained by Conventional Parallel Imaging and Compressed Sensing in Patients with Various\\nShoulder Diseases\\n\\nParticipants\\nYuki Obama, Toyoake, Japan (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nYoshiharu Ohno, MD,PhD, Toyoake, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Research Grant, Canon Medical Systems Corporation; Research\\nGrant, DAIICHI SANKYO Group; ; \\nKaori Yamamoto, Otawara, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Employee, Canon Medical Systems Corportion\\nSatomu Hanamatsu, Aichi, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nTakahiro Ueda, Toyoake, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nKazuhiro Murayama, MD, Toyoake, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Research Grant, Canon Medical Systems Corporation\\nAkiyoshi Iwase, RT, Toyoake, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nTakashi Fukuba, RT, Toyoake, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nHirotaka Ikeda, MD, Toyoake, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nMasato Ikedo, Otawara, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Employee, Canon Medical Systems Corporation\\nMasao Yui, Otawara, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Employee, Canon Medical Systems Corporation\\nHiroshi Toyama, Toyoake, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Research Grant, Canon Medical Systems Corporation\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nerdbeeremilch49@gmail.com\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo prospectively and directly determine the capability of newly developed deep learning reconstruction (DLR) for image quality\\nimprovement on MRI obtained by conventional parallel imaging (PI) and compressed sensing (CS) in patients with different shoulder\\ndiseases.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThirty consecutive patients with various shoulder diseases underwent MRI at a 3T MR system by conventional PI and CS. Then,\\neach MR data was reconstructed with and without DLR. For determination quantitative image quality improvement of each\\nacquisition with and without DLR, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of humeral head, percentage of coefficient of variations (%CVs) and\\ncontrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were determined by ROI measurements in all patients. For qualitative image quality assessment, two\\nradiologists evaluated overall image quality, artifacts and diagnostic confidence level (DCL) by 5-point scoring system, and final\\nvalue of each index was made by consensus of two readers. To compare quantitative image quality indexes, each index was\\ncompared among all methods by Tukey\\'s HSD test. On qualitative image quality evaluation, inter-observer agreement of each index\\nwas firstly determined by weighted-kappa statistics. Then, Wilcoxon signed-rank test was performed to compare each index among\\nall methods.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nCS with and without DLR showed significantly shorter examination times than conventional PI (p0.05). Inter-observer agreements\\nfor overall image quality and artifact of CS with and without DLR were substantial (0.730.05).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nCS can significantly reduce examination time than PI.

Thick-slice image\\nwith 3 mm slice thickness was reconstructed from the original image of 1 mm slice thickness with a downsampling factor of 3, and\\nthe convolutional neural network was trained to develop thin-slice images from the thick-slice images using these image pairs. Cubic\\ninterpolation was applied, and patches were extracted prior to the network development. For the validation dataset, we used 50\\nseparate MR scans with a 2D FSE T2-weighted sequence. The validation dataset composed of 50 patients who were\\narthroscopically confirmed for the presence or absence of SLAP lesions. For the quantitative evaluation, we calculated the peak\\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), mean-squared-error (MSE), and structural similarity index (SSIM). For the observer performance\\nstudy, two board-certified radiologists evaluated the possibility of SLAP lesions with a 5-point Likert scale on both the original 3 mm\\nthickness and 1 mm super-resolution images.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe quantitative performance of cubic interpolation was PSNR 69.75, MSE 0.0090, and SSIM 0.9756. And the performance of our\\nproposed super-resolution method was PSNR 71.12, MSE 0.0066, and SSIM 0.9790. Among the patients in the validation dataset,\\n31 patients were arthroscopically diagnosed with SLAP lesions, and 19 patients were confirmed to be without a labral tear. The\\ndiagnostic accuracy of the radiology fellow was increased from AUC 0.673 for thick-slice images to AUC 0.707 for super-resolution\\nimages. And the performance of the staff radiologist was improved from AUC 0.746 to 0.775 using the super-resolution images.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThrough-plane super-resolution shoulder MRI was able to develop high-resolution thin-slice images, improving diagnostic accuracy\\nfor the SLAP lesions.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThe super-resolution method can be used to increase the diagnostic accuracy of abnormalities in small structures such as labrum in\\nshoulder MRI.\\n\\nSSMK08-05 Usefulness of Shear Wave Elastography for Preoperative Evaluation of the Supraspinatus Muscle in\\n\\nTendon Tears: Could It Predict the Reparability of the Torn Supraspinatus Tendon?\\n\\nParticipants\\nEun Kyung Khil, MD, Hwaseong, Korea, Republic Of (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nJeung Yeol Jeong, MD, Hwaseong-si, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJung-Ah Choi, MD, Hwaseong, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJoonsuk Park, MD, Hwaseong-si, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nnizzinim@gmail.com\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo evaluate the supraspinatus (SST) muscle quality in tendon tears using shear wave elastography (SWE), and to analyze the\\ncorrelation between muscle elasticity and tendon reparability and other measuring tools for muscle quality on MRI.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\n46 patients (mean age: 62.02[±8.67], range 45-79, 26 men, 20 women) with SST tears were prospectively recruited and\\nunderwent preoperative MRI and US, including SWE from May 2019 to April 2020. Using SWE, the elasticity value(kPa) of the SST\\nmuscle and the ratio (SST/trapezius muscles) were determined. Two radiologists evaluated the degree of fatty degeneration of the\\nSST muscle using Goutallier\\'s grade (GG), occupation ratio (OCR), and muscle atrophy grade (MA) on MRI; interobserver agreement\\nwas measured by Kappa statistics and intraclass correlation coefficient. Tendon reparability was divided into grades 1 to 4\\naccording to the degree of tendon repair, and was subdivided into group I (complete or near complete repair, grade 1 and 2, n=41)\\nand II (incomplete repair and repair failure, grade 3 and 4, n=5). In both groups, elasticity value and ratio, and other measuring\\ntools (GG, OCR, MA) were compared and analyzed for correlations using Spearman or Pearson\\'s correlation analysis.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nOf the SWE values, the elasticity ratio showed a significant difference between the two groups (group I and II: 1.92[±0.85],\\n3.14[±1.12], respectively, p=0.05); the cut off value was 2.58. Other values, including GG, OCR, and MA also revealed significant\\ndifferences between the two groups (p<0.01), with substantial to almost perfect interobserver agreements (0.86, 0.94, 0.78,\\n\\n\\x0crespectively, p <0.001).For correlation analyses, the elasticity value showed a weak to moderate correlation with GG and MA\\n(r=0.37, 0.49, p<0.01). The elasticity ratio showed moderate correlations with GG, OCR, and MA (r=0.54, -0.47, 0.50, p<0.001) and\\nshowed a weak correlation with tendon reparability (r=0.38, p=0.01).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIn the preoperative evaluation of the SST muscle quality using SWE, especially elasticity ratio, showed moderate correlation with\\nthe existing muscle evaluating tools and was significantly increased in the patient group with incomplete reparability.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nSWE may be useful to predict the tendon reparability by evaluating muscle quality in patients with SST tendon tear.\\n\\nSSMK08-06 Magnetic Resonance Neurography (MRN) Mapping of Suprascapular, Long Thoracic and Axillary\\n\\nNerve Constrictions in Parsonage-Turner Syndrome (PTS)\\n\\nParticipants\\nSophie C.

An MSK-trained radiologist reviewed MRN exams performed from July 2016-March 2020. All MRN exams were acquired\\nat 3.0T using 32-channel coil arrays and combined 2D and 3D T2-weighted, fat-suppressed sequences. The locations of severe\\n(i.e. >90% reduced caliber), focal (<1cm long) HGCs were defined in 2 ways: 1) general anatomic region; 2) manually measured\\ndistance from osseous landmark (SSN: suprascapular notch; AXN: base of coracoid process).\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nSixty cases were identified and 5 excluded due to inadequate SNR (4) or motion artifact (1). The final cohort comprised 55 subjects\\n(15F; x̅age 45 years) with SSN (21, 38%), LTN (16, 29%), AXN (8, 15%), SSN+AXN (9, 16%) and SSN+LTN (1, 2%) involvement. In\\ntotal, 61 HGCs were identified in 40 subjects. Of the remaining 15 subjects, 12 had clinical LTN involvement with poor nerve\\nvisualization on MRN.SSN HGCs (n=44) were, on average, 3.5 cm proximal to the suprascapular notch (interquartile range, IQ: 2.7)\\nand localized to retroclavicular (71%), supraclavicular (23%) or infraclavicular (7%) regions. AXN HGCs (n=13) were, on average,\\n3.0 cm (IQ: 3.4) distal to the base of the coracoid process in regions defined by the anteroinferior margin of the subscapularis\\nmuscle (69%), quadrilateral space (15%) or area medial to the coracoid (15%). LTN HGCs (n=8) were in the\\ninfraclavicular/retropectoral region (63%), along the posterolateral border of the middle scalene muscle (25%) or along the inferior\\nchest wall (13%).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nSevere HGCs of the most commonly involved nerves in PTS tend to cluster in particular anatomic regions, which suggests that\\ncertain sites may predispose the nerve to developing HGCs due to biomechanical stress and/or ischemia. Further investigation into\\nlocoregional anatomy, including fascial planes and vasculature supply, is warranted.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nRecognizing the anatomic localization patterns of HGCs in PTS may aid diagnostic recognition of these sites on imaging and shed\\nlight on disease pathophysiology.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSMK09\\n\\nMusculoskeletal (Elbow, Wrist, Hand)\\n\\nFriday, Dec. 4 5:00PM - 6:00PM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nCT\\n\\nER MK MR US OI\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .75\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSMK09-01 The Flexed Elbow Valgus External Rotation (FEVER) MRI View for UCL Evaluation in Throwing\\n\\nAthletes\\n\\nParticipants\\nPamela J.

We hypothesized that the FEVER view would show ulnotrochlear joint space widening due to valgus stress\\ncompared to the standard MRI adding functional ligament information and improving reader confidence for UCL evaluation.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nTwo readers reviewed the standard elbow MRI (standard) and standard plus FEVER view (FEVER) of 39 MLB pitchers, measured the\\nulnotrochlear joint space, evaluated the UCL for injury grade, signal type, location, periligamentous edema and retraction and\\nrecorded confidence scores. FEVER was performed with the shoulder immobilized in external rotation, shoulder and elbow flexed to\\n90°, forearm externally rotated and hand supinated. The elbow was elevated with two sandbags and 2 sandbags (7.6 lbs) were\\nplaced on the distal forearm to produce valgus stress. Oblique coronal PDFS, 2 mm UCL images were aquired. Data analyses\\ncompared UT joint space differences, inter-rater reliabilities, imaging findings and confidence scores on standard and FEVER.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\n78.9% increase in UT joint space was found between the standard and FEVER, with average increase of 1.7 mm (0.3 - 3.9 mm)\\n(p<0.001). Inter-rater agreement on normal or abnormal UCL was seen in 36 of 39 (92.3%) subjects for both standard and FEVER.\\nThree additional patients were diagnosed with UCL abnormalities on FEVER. Reader confidence was significantly increased on FEVER\\ncompared to standard with overall confidence difference of 1.08 for reader 1 and 0.77 for reader 2 (p<0.001). The FEVER view\\ntrended toward more abnormal UCLs, higher injury grades, more distal tears, and higher signal compared to standard view.\\nRetraction and periligamentous edema were observed 12.8% and 10.8% less frequently on FEVER compared to the standard. 95%\\nof subjects had discomfort level <5 on a 10 point scale.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe FEVER elbow MRI view added to standard elbow imaging produces elbow valgus stress with increased reader confidence for UCL\\nevaluation in professional baseball pitchers compared to the standard elbow MRI alone.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThis study indicates that the FEVER view is a practical, reproducible addition to standard MRI imaging that produces elbow valgus\\nstress which may provide functional UCL information and improve MRI evaluation of the UCL in throwing athletes.\\n\\nSSMK09-02 T2 Mapping of the Articular Cartilage of the Elbow Joint at 3.0 Tesla MRI in Asymptomatic\\n\\nVolunteers: A Feasibility and Reproducibility Study\\n\\nParticipants\\nJoonsuk Park, MD, Hwaseong-si, Korea, Republic Of (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nJung-Ah Choi, MD, Hwaseong, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nEun Kyung Khil, MD, Hwaseong, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nWoo Rim Seo, MD, Hwaseong, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo evaluate the feasibility and reproducibility of T2 relaxation time measurements at cartilages of the elbow joint in asymptomatic\\nindividuals at 3.0 T MRI.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\n\\x0cThis prospective study was approved by our IRB and written informed consent was obtained. Thirty elbow joints in seventeen\\nasymptomatic volunteers without history of trauma or surgery of the elbow (age range: 22-34 years, mean age: 27.8 year, 9 men,\\n8 women) underwent MR imaging, including T2 mapping, using 3.0 T scanner from July 2019 to September 2019.

A specific pattern\\nof superficial subcutaneous edema seen on non-contrast STIR MR images, which we termed the dermal rim sign (DRS), may provide\\nan alternative method of diagnosis that is more accessible and less invasive. The goal was to determine if DRS on MRI is predictive\\nof dermal backflow seen on lymphoscintigraphy in patients with secondary upper extremity lymphedema.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nBilateral upper extremity MRI and lymphoscintigraphy were performed on patients referred from the lymphedema clinic between\\nMarch and October 2018. The sensitivity and specificity of DRS in detecting dermal backflow were calculated, and the locations of\\nthe sign and dermal backflow were compared. Correlation between DRS, ICG lymphography, bioimpedance spectroscopy ratio and\\nMRI Lymphedema Staging was calculated. Linear weighted interobserver agreements on the presence of dermal backflow on\\nlymphoscintigraphy, and the location of DRS on MRI were calculated.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\n33 patients were included in the analysis. 91.1% of patients had history of breast cancer. The average age was 58.4 ± 10.5 years\\nold (range 31-75), with a mean symptom duration of 4.7 ± 4.4 years. The mean BMI (kg/m2) was 30.5 ± 7.0. DRS was seen in 32\\nout of 33 patients that demonstrated dermal backflow on lymphoscintigraphy. DRS was absent in all 11 symptomatic limbs that did\\nnot demonstrate dermal backflow on lymphoscintigraphy. Sensitivity and specificity of DRS for dermal backflow were 96.6% [95%\\nconfidence interval (CI):81.7%-99.9%], and 75.0% [CI:47.6%-92.7%], respectively. Positive and negative predictive values were\\n87.5% [CI:74.9%-94.3%] and 92.3% [CI:63.1%-98.8%]. Interobserver agreement on the extent of DRS on MRI was 0.92 [CI:0.85-\\n1]. DRS also correlates with worse MRI Stage, ICG lymphography and bioimpedance (p<.05, p<.001, p<.001, respectively).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe dermal rim sign correlates highly with dermal backflow and widely used clinical measures and may be used as a noninvasive\\ndiagnostic MRI marker of lymphatic dysfunction and lymphedema.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThe dermal rim sign seen on MRI may be used as a surrogate for dermal backflow, which is seen on lymphoscintigraphy.\\n\\nSSMK09-04 Foveal Triangular Fibrocartilage Avulsion of the Distal Radioulnar Joint: How Accurate Is MR\\n\\nArthrography?\\n\\nParticipants\\nMatthias Streif, MD, Basel, Switzerland (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nFilippo del Grande, MD, Lugano, Switzerland (Abstract Co-Author) Institutional research collaboration, Siemens AGSpeaker, Siemens\\n\\n\\x0cAGSpeaker, Bayer AG\\nAlexandre Kaempfen, Basel, Switzerland (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nFelix Amsler, Basel, Switzerland (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nAnna Hirschmann, MD, Basel, Switzerland (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nMatthias.Streif@usb.ch\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nInstabilities of the distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) are clinically indistinct and require selective testing by DRUJ arthroscopy and a hook\\ntest of the foveal attachment of the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC). We investigated if avulsion of the foveal attachment\\n(Atzei 3) and the volar and dorsal stabilizing ligaments of the TFCC can be sufficiently diagnosed on MR arthrography (MRA) to\\npredict instability of the DRUJ.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nIn this retrospective monocenter study 37 patients with ulnar sided wrist pain (instability group; mean age 38.6 ±11.2 years; 13\\nfemale; 24 male) underwent arthroscopy with a positive hook test and 3T MRA between 2013 and 2019. Twelve patients with\\nnegative hook test and 37 patients without ulnar sided wrist pain comprised the control group. Two fellowship-trained\\nmusculoskeletal radiologists independently evaluated all MRA in a random distribution and blinded to clinical and surgical data as\\nfollows: foveal TFCC attachment, dorsal and volar radioulnar ligament (intact, scaring, partial/full avulsion). A 15-point score with\\nligament integrity results was created to calculate sensitivity, specificity and accuracy. Height-to-length ratio (HLR) of the TFCC\\nwas measured. ANOVA was calculating for HLR differences between groups (p<0.05). Interrater agreement was calculated\\n(weighted kappa, κ).\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nPartial avulsion of the foveal TFCC was evident in 30% (11/37), full avulsion in 62% (23/37). Additional foveal scaring was detected\\nin 30% (11/37). Dorsal radioulnar ligament tears were detected in 70% (16/37 partial avulsion, 10/37 full avulsion) and volar\\nligament tears in 49% (11/37 partial avulsion, 7/37 full avulsion). A positive hook test could be predicted with a score of at least 5\\nof 15 points with a sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of 76%, 100% and 89%, respectively. HLR did not reveal significant\\ndifferences between groups (p=0.486). Interrater agreement was excellent for HLR (ICC, 0.92), good for foveal insertion (κ, 0.72)\\nand poor for dorsal (κ, 0.29) and volar (κ, 0.20) radioulnar ligaments.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nFoveal avulsions of the TFCC can be accurately detected using MRA. Presence of additional volar and dorsal ligament tears\\nincreased the likelihood of a foveal detachment.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nDetection of foveal avulsions using MRA aid surgeons in precisely selecting patients with clinical indistinct instability of the DRUJ and\\nindicate adequate therapy of the TFCC.\\n\\nSSMK09-05 Comparison of 3T and 7T MRI for Direct Visualization of Finger Pulley Injuries - An Ex-vivo Study\\n\\nParticipants\\nRafael Heiss, Erlangen, Germany (Presenter) Speakers Bureau, Siemens AG\\nChristoph Lutter, Bamberg, Germany (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nMichael Uder, MD, Erlangen, Germany (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nArmin Nagel, Erlangen, Germany (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nThomas Bayer, MD, Erlangen, Germany (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nFrank W.

MRI protocols were comparable in duration. Two experienced radiologists evaluated the MRIs and defined the\\nlocation and morphology of finger pulley lesions. Image quality was graded according to a 4-point Likert scale. The diagnostic\\nperformance was assessed with anatomic preparation as gold standard. Interobserver agreement was calculated by using Cohen\\'s\\nKappa coefficients (κ).\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\n7T MRI was more sensitive in the detection of A2, A3 and A4 pulley lesions compared to 3T MRI at 3T (100% vs. 95%), but less\\nspecific (98% vs. 100%). In the assessment of A3 pulley lesions sensitivity of 7T was superior to 3T MRI (100% vs. 83%), whereas\\nspecificity was lower (95% vs. 100%). Image quality assessed before iatrogenic rupture was comparable with 2.7 for 7T, 2.5 for\\n3T. After pulley rupture image quality was rated with 2.8, both for 3T and 7T. Interobserver variability at 7T (κ=0.90) was superior\\nto 3T (κ=0.80).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nMRI at 3T and 7T allows direct visualization and characterization of traumatic A2, A3 and A4 pulley lesions with higher agreement\\nrates for 7T.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nHigh field MRI allows direct visualization of pulley ruptures, which is a modern approach for the pre-surgical evaluation compared to\\nindirect techniques such as ultrasound depending of bowstringing.\\n\\n\\x0cSSMK09-06 Color-Coded Virtual Noncalcium Dual-Energy CT for the Depiction of Scaphoid Bone Marrow Edema:\\n\\na Multireader Diagnostic Accuracy Study\\n\\nParticipants\\nChristian Booz, MD, Frankfurt am Main, Germany (Presenter) Speaker, Siemens AG\\nIbrahim Yel, MD, Frankfurt, Germany (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nFelix C.

Six radiologists, blinded to MRI and clinical data, independently evaluated conventional grayscale dual-energy CT series\\nfor the presence of fractures; after 8 weeks, readers reevaluated all cases using color-coded dual-energy CT VNCa reconstructions\\nfor the presence of bone marrow edema for three scaphoid zones according to the Mayo classification. Quantitative analysis of CT\\nnumbers on VNCa reconstructions was performed by a seventh blinded radiologist. Results from MRI evaluated by two separate\\nblinded experienced radiologists (20 and 32 years of experience in musculoskeletal imaging) served as standard of reference.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nMRI revealed a total of 101 traumatic bone marrow edemas in 121 regions (25 distal, 72 central, 24 proximal). In the qualitative\\nanalysis, VNCa reconstructions yielded high overall sensitivity (96%), specificity (97%), positive predictive value (92%), negative\\npredictive value (98%) and accuracy (96%) for the assessment of scaphoid bone marrow edema. Inter-reader agreement was\\nexcellent (κ=0.92). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed an area under the curve of 0.968 (distal), 0.965\\n(middle) and 0.961 (proximal). CT numbers obtained from VNCa were significantly different with and without edema (P<.001). A cut-\\noff value of -22 HU provided an overall sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 93% for the differentiation of bone marrow edema.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nDual-energy CT VNCa reconstructions yield excellent diagnostic accuracy for the assessment of scaphoid bone marrow edema in\\npatients with acute wrist trauma by enabling direct color-coded visualization.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nScaphoid bone marrow edema can be accurately visualized using color-coded VNCa reconstructions.

At 75 min post injection, dPET acquisitions were performed using a 10x faster acquisition time of 9 s/bed followed\\nby dPET acquisitions using standard 90 s/bed at 80 min post injection. All dPET image data sets were reconstructed using Time-of-\\nFlight and standard-definition approaches (voxel volume = 4x4x4 mm3). A blinded reader panel using an Intellispace Portal\\nworkstation evaluated by matched pair comparison the overall image quality, background quality, and lesion detectability.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nAll patients had evaluable dPET data sets (n = 70) for qualitative and quantitative assessment of 18F biodistribution and\\nosteoblastic activity. Faster 9 s/bed dPET acquisitions demonstrated comparable 18F-avidity in both normal bone and osteoblastic\\nlesion conspicuity when compared to standard acquisitions with no discordant osteoblastic lesions. Average SUVmean were\\ncomparable for 9 s/bed and 90 s/bed acquisitions for background skeletal muscle (0.6 ± 0.1 and 0.7 ± 0.1, respectively) and normal\\nvertebral bone (6.0 ± 1.1 and 6.6 ± 1.2, respectively). Average SUVmax of 134 osteoblastic lesions were also comparable for 9\\ns/bed and 90 s/bed acquisitions (29.8 ± 27.1 and 34.9 ± 28.7, respectively and not significantly different).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThere remains an unmet clinical need to significantly reduce PET image acquisition times for oncologic patients with symptomatic\\nosseous disease. This Phase Ib study demonstrates the clinical feasibility of 10x faster whole-body Na18F PET imaging of\\nosteoblastic disease with dPET technology.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nDigital photon counting PET detector technology enables 10x faster whole-body Na18F PET (total imaging time ~3 min) with no loss\\nof lesion detectability, image quality or quantitative accuracy.\\n\\nSSNM01-02 Impact of PSMA PET/CT on SRT Planning: Preliminary Results From a Randomized Phase III Trial\\n\\nParticipants\\nJeremie Calais, MD, Los Angeles, CA (Presenter) Consultant, RadioMedix, IncConsultant, Blue Earth Diagnostics LtdConsultant,\\nProgenics Pharmaceuticals, IncConsultant, Johnson & JohnsonConsultant, Curium SASConsultant, General Electric Company\\nWesley R.

The primary endpoint is the success rate of SRT\\nmeasured as biochemical progression-free survival (PFS) at 5 years. We hypothesized that the incorporation of PSMA PET to SRT\\nplanning will improve 5-year PFS survival by 20%: 60% in Arm 1 and 80% in Arm 2. We report the preliminary results of the impact\\nof PSMA PET on SRT planning by comparing the pre-randomization RT plans prospectively obtained on surveys to the actually\\ndelivered RT plans.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\n153 patients were enrolled from 09.06.2018 to 01.24.2020. 7/75 patients (9%) in the control arm dropped-out the study to undergo\\na PSMA PET at another institution. After a median follow-up of 10.6 months delivered RT plans were obtained in 44/68 (65%) and\\n50/78 (64%) of patients of the control and the PSMA arms, respectively. In these, median PSA at enrollment was 0.42 ng/ml (IQR\\n0.20-1.75) in the control and 0.22 ng/ml (IQR 0.13-0.59) in the PSMA arm. PSMA PET was positive in 24/50 (48%): 5/50 (10%)\\nshowed prostate cancer outside of the pelvis, 12/50 (24%) in pelvic nodes and 8/50 (16%) in the prostate bed only. There was a\\nchange between the intended pre-randomization RT plan and the actually delivered RT plan in 28/50 (56%) and 14/44 (32%) of the\\npatients in the PSMA and the control arm, respectively (p = 0.019). SRT was aborted in favor of systemic therapy and/or\\nmetastasis directed RT for extra-pelvic M1 disease in 4/50 (8%) of the PSMA arm vs. 1/44 (2%) in the control arm (p = 0.21). Dose\\nprescription and/or target volume delineation was changed in 14/50 (28%) in the PSMA arm vs 3/44 (7%) in the control arm (p =\\n0.008).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIn this prospective randomized phase 3 study, PSMA PET had an impact on the RT plan in more than half of the patients. Notably,\\n8% of PSMA patients did not undergo SRT because the scan revealed extra-pelvic metastases.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nLong-term follow-up will show if the impact of PSMA PET on SRT planning improves PFS.\\n\\nSSNM01-04 [F-18]siPSMA-14 PET/CT Acquired at 90 Minutes p.i.

With this background aimed to find the optimal time point for\\nacquiring PET/CT using the novel PSMA-specific PET radiotracer [F-18]siPSMA-14 in prostate cancer (PCa) patients.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\n47 consecutive PCa patients (69 ± 7y; GS 6-9, median (range) PSA 3.2 (0.009-1000) ng/ml) referred for PSMA-PET/CT were\\nretrospectively analyzed. Images were acquired in 7 patients both at 60 (T1) and 120 (T3); in 40 patients images were acquired\\nonly at 90 (T2) minutes after injection of [F-18]siPSMA-14 (344.08 ± 11.7 MBq) without using furosemide. Contrast enhanced CT\\nwas performed in all patients unless contraindicated. SUVmean in a fixed size Region of interest (ROI) was drawn on normal organs\\nand malignant lesions (prostatic lesions (PL) including intraprostatic and local residue), bone (BM), lymph node (LM) and adrenal\\ngland(AM) metastases). T1 and T3 were considered for changes in uptake over time. Target/non target ratios (TTR) were\\ncalculated by comparig SUVmean of tumor lesions with background activity. T-test was performed to assess the significance of\\ndifferences in SUVmean.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nPL and metastatic lesions (ML) as small as up to 3 mm were visualized at all time points. The SUVmean of PL at T1, T2 and T3 was\\n6.9, 9.6 and 8.2. TTR of PL / bladder at T1/T3 and T2 were 0.7/0.9 and 1.9. Mean TTR at T1/T3 for LM (n=2); BM (n=2) and AM\\n(n=1) were 21.4/24.2; 5.3/5.8; 41.2/46.8. The mean SUVmean of ML at T2 was 23.8 ± 9.6. Mean TTR at T2 for LM (n=17); BM\\n(n=11) and AM (n=1) were 14.3; 18.6 and 30.2. Amongst normal organs, the kidneys showed highest radiotracer uptake and\\nincreased significantly (p<0.05) in delayed images acquired at T3 whereas in liver and pancreas the uptake reamined stable over\\n\\n\\x0ctime.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n[F-18]siPSMA-14 PET/CT images acquired at 90 minutes without furosemide-induced forced diuresis provides optimal contrast for\\nstaging and restaging of prostate cancer patients.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\n[F-18]siPSMA-14 PET/CT image acquisition at 90 minutes p.i. without furosemide seems most favourable for primary staging and\\nrestaging of prostate cancer patients.\\n\\nSSNM01-05 Factors Associated with Change in Management Due to Inclusion of PSMA PET CT in Pre-operative\\n\\nStaging of Patients with High Risk Prostate Cancer\\n\\nParticipants\\nGregory P. Tarr, MBChB, PhD, Auckland , New Zealand (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nThere is emerging data supporting the use of PSMA PET CT in pre-operative staging amongst patients with high risk prostate\\ncancer. The aim of the study was to assess clinical and imaging features associated with change in management for patients\\nscanned for this indication.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nPatients with high-risk prostate cancer undergoing Ga68 PSMA PET/CT at Mercy Radiology, Auckland, New Zealand were\\nprospectively recruited. Conventional staging was double read in a blinded fashion by oncology fellowship-trained radiologists, who\\nwere also experienced in PSMA PET/CT. The PSMA PET/CT was subsequently read by the same radiologists. Confirmation of\\nchanges in management decision were obtained from the treating surgeon and multidisciplinary team meeting records. Ethical\\napproval was obtained from the Health and Disability Ethics Committee. All patients gave written informed consent.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nA total of 49 patients were scanned. Three who were otherwise eligible for radical prostatectomy elected alternative treatments,\\nleaving 46 patients included for analysis in the study. There was change in management in 16 (34.8%) of patients. Both clinical and\\nimaging-related variables were predictive of management changes. There was a step-wise increase in likelihood of management\\nchange with increasing Gleason score. A larger proportion of core biopsy samples positive for disease was predictive of change in\\nmanagement. The SUVmax of the primary lesion was also higher in patients with a change in management than those\\nwithout).When these variables were included in in a stepwise logistic regression model, Gleason score emerged as the best\\npredictor of change in management, with an adjusted odds ratio of 2.9 (95% CI 1.01 to 8.3, P=0.047) for each point increase in the\\nGleason scale.However, even patients in the lowest quartiles of the combination of these variables had frequent management\\nchanges, and these was no cut off point evident below which inclusion of PSMA was futile.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nFactors associated with increased likelihood for management changes in patients being staged for high risk prostate cancer included\\nhigher Gleason score, numbers of cores positive, and SUVmax of the index lesion. However, even patients with low levels of these\\nvariables frequently benefited from the inclusion of PSMA in the staging algorithm.

Froelich, MD, Minnetonka, MN (Abstract Co-Author) Researcher, Siemens AG\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\n18F-FACBC PET imaging has been increasingly used in the restaging of prostate cancer patients with biochemical recurrence (BCR);\\nhowever, its clinical utility in patients with low PSA levels following primary radiation therapy is still unclear. We aimed to determine\\nthe detection rate and diagnostic accuracy of 18F-FACBC PET and the patterns of prostate cancer recurrence in patients with BCR\\nafter initial radiation therapy, particularly in patients with a PSA rise below the accepted ASTRO/Phoenix definition of PSA failure\\n(PSA nadir + 2).\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nAfter obtaining institutional review board (IRB) approval from two tertiary institutions; imaging, clinical, and histopathology data of\\nconsecutive patients who underwent 18F-FACBC PET/CT or PET/MRI scans for elevated PSA level following initial radiation therapy\\nwere analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the predictive value of PSA and PSA kinetic\\nparameters for a positive 18F-FACBC PET.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nOne hundred patients were included. The median PSA was 3.3 ng/mL. The overall detection rate on a patient-level was 78%\\n\\n\\x0c(78/100). FACBC was positive in 62%(23/37) of cases below the ASTRO/Phoenix criteria, with a median PSA of 1.25 ng/mL. Local\\nrecurrence was the most findings, occurring in 67%(67/100) of patients, with isolated local recurrence in 56%(56/100) of cases. In\\n58 patients with biopsy(n=44) or composite follow-up imaging, the sensitivity and positive predictive value of 18F-FACBC PET were\\n91%(95%CI: 78-97%) and 89%(95%CI: 80-94%), respectively. The detection rate was 60%(18/30) in patients with PSA < 2.0\\nng/ml. In patients with PSA below the ASTRO/Phoenix criteria, the PSA velocity had the highest predictive value of a positive 18F-\\nFACBC PET with an area under the curve (AUC) of 79%.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n18F-FACBC PET identified recurrent disease with a PSA rise less than the ASTRO/Phoenix criteria in 62% of subjects. Isolated local\\nrecurrence is the most common finding, which accentuates the importance of early detection of recurrent disease after initial\\nradiation therapy. In patients with PSA below the ASTRO/Phoenix criteria, the PSA velocity can help identify patients who would\\nbenefit from 18F-FACBC PET.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nIn patients with biochemical recurrence after initial radiation therapy, 18F-FACBC PET can identify recurrent disease in majority of\\ncases with a PSA rise less than the ASTRO/Phoenix criteria (PSA nadir + 2).\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSNR03\\n\\nScience Session with Keynote: Neuroradiology (Brain-Stroke Imaging 1)\\n\\nSunday, Nov. 29 8:30AM - 9:30AM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nCT GU\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .75\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSNR03-01 Neuroradiology Keynote Speaker: Recent Advances in Stroke Imaging\\n\\nParticipants\\nJeremy J.

The Inception-V1 3D convolutional neural\\nnetwork (CNN) architecture pretrained on the Kinetics dataset was used to train a series classifier and tested on a 10% holdout\\nset. Axial arterial phase MIPs in 7,433 studies (7,332 patients) from Inst1 were obtained. Data were labeled into 3 classes via\\nreview of the original radiology report: without LVO (\\'normal\\'), chronic LVO, and acute LVO. The data were split into 10\\ntrain/validation/test (80%/10%/10%) partitions for 10-fold cross-validation. Additionally, 683 studies positive for LVO from\\nInstitution 2 (Inst2) were used as an independent test set. An Inception-V1 3D CNN was used to train a classifier for acute LVO,\\nchronic LVO, and normal. Final predictions were made by a 3-model ensemble.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe series classifier achieved an accuracy of 96% and AUC of 1.0 in identifying the axial arterial phase MIP and thin data. Inst1\\ncontained 219 (2.9%) acute LVOs, 1,011 (13.6%) chronic LVOs, and 6,203 (83.5%) normal studies. Inst2 contained 185 (27.4%)\\nacute LVOs and 490 (72.6%) chronic LVOs. For Inst1, the cross-validated AUCs for acute LVO vs. not and LVO vs. normal were\\n0.824 (95% CI: 0.793, 0.853) and 0.793 (95% CI: 0.779, 0.807), respectively. For acute LVO vs. not (Inst1), the model achieved\\n30% specificity at a sensitivity of 95%. Similarly, sensitivity was 43% at a specificity of 95%. The series classifier achieved 98.2%\\naccuracy on Inst2 data. Generalizability was limited to evaluating performance of acute vs. chronic LVO given data availability. For\\nInst1 and Inst2, the AUCs for this task were 0.655 (95% CI: 0.614, 0.694) and 0.638 (95% CI: 0.590, 0.687), respectively.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n3D CNNs were effective in identifying series of interest and acute LVOs in CT angiography. At a 5% false positive rate, over 40% of\\nacute LVOs would be successfully identified without manual intervention.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nDeep learning can facilitate prompt and fully-automated identification of acute LVOs in CTA to decrease time-to-treatment for\\nstroke patients.\\n\\n\\x0cSSNR03-03 Perfusion Imaging to Select Patients With Large Ischemic Core for Mechanical Thrombectomy\\n\\nParticipants\\nBasile Kerleroux, MD, Paris, France (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nKevin Janot, MD, Tours, France (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nCyril Dargazanli, Montpellier, France (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nDimitri Daly Eraya, MD, Montpellier, France (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nWagih Ben Hassen, MD, Paris, France (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nFrancois Zhu, Nancy, France (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nBenjamin Gory, Bron, France (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJean-Francois Hak, Paris, France (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nFlorent Gariel, Montbonnot, France (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nGaultier Marnat, Bordeaux, France (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nAymeric Rouchaud Rouchaud, Limoges, France (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nGeraud Forestier, Limoges, France (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJoseph Benzakoun, Paris, France (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nLili Detraz, Nantes, France (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nRomain Bourcier, Nantes, France (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nPasquale Mordasini, MD,MSc, Bern, Switzerland (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJohannes Kaesmacher, MD, Bern, Switzerland (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nGregoire Boulouis, MD, MSc, Paris, France (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nPatients with acute ischemic stroke, proximal vessel occlusion and a large ischemic core at presentation are commonly not\\nconsidered for mechanical thrombectomy (MT). We tested the hypothesis that in patients with baseline large infarct cores,\\nidentification of remaining penumbral tissue using perfusion imaging would translate to better outcomes after MT.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nMulticenter, retrospective, core lab adjudicated, cohort study of adult patients with proximal vessel occlusion, a large ischemic core\\nvolume (DWI volume >= 70ml), with pre-treatment MRI perfusion, treated with MT (2015-2018) or medical care alone (controls;\\nbefore 2015). Primary outcome measure was 3-months favorable outcome (defined as a modified Rankin scale, mRs of 0-3). Core\\nPerfusion Mismatch Ratio (CPMR) was defined as the volume of critically hypo-perfused tissue (Tmax > 6s) divided by the core\\nvolume. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine factors that were independently associated with clinical\\noutcomes. Outputs are displayed as adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR) and 95% CI.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nA total of 172 patients were included (MT n=130; Control n=42; mean age 69.0±15.4 years; 36% females). Mean core-volume and\\nCPMR were 102.3ml (±SD 36.7) and 1.8±0.7 respectively. As hypothesized, receiving MT was associated with increased probability\\nof favourable outcome and functional independence, as CPMR increased, a difference becoming statistically significant above a\\nmismatch-ratio of 1.72. Similarly, receiving MT was also associated with favourable outcome in the subgroup of 74 patients with\\nCPMR >1.7 (aOR 8.12, 95%CI [1.24-53.11], p=0.028). Overall (prior to stratification by CPMR),73 (42.4%) patients had a\\nfavourable outcome at 3 months, with no difference amongst groups.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIn patients currently deemed ineligible for MT due to large infarct ischemic cores at baseline, CPMR identifies a subgroup strongly\\nbenefiting from MT. Prospective studies are warranted.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nIn this cohort study of 172 patients with infarct cores >=70ml at baseline, mechanical thrombectomy was associated with\\nsignificantly higher odds of favourable outcome above a core / perfusion mismatch ratio of 1.7 when compared to controls.Perfusion\\nimaging, when demonstrating large mismatch profiles, may help to properly select patients with large ischemic core at baseline for\\nmechanical thrombectomy.\\n\\nSSNR03-04 Volumetric and Regional Atlas-Based Analysis of Diffusion MRI for Neuroprognistication in Comatose\\n\\nCardiac Arrest Patients\\n\\nParticipants\\nEvan D.

Whole cortex ADC\\nvalues were significantly higher in group 1 with a median of 822x10-6 mm2/s compared to 756x10-6 mm2/s in group 2 (p=0.008).\\nAverage volume of cortex with ADC <650x10-6 mm2/s was 10.0 mL in group 1 compared to 63.7 mL in group 2 (p=0.005). Several\\nstatistically significant regional differences in ADC values and thresholded volumes were detected throughout the brain,\\npredominantly involving the frontotemporal cortices and insula. The largest differences in ADC between groups were in the inferior\\nfrontal gyri (860x10-6 mm2/s in group 1 versus 769x10-6 mm2/s in group 2, p=0.005). The largest differences in thresholded\\nvolumes of brain tissue with ADC <650x10-6 mm2/s were in the frontal poles (1.1 mL in group 1 versus 10.3 mL in group 2,\\np=0.004).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nA combined approach to brain MR imaging with volumetric threshold measures of ADC and regional analyses demonstrates significant\\nglobal and regional differences associated with in-hospital mortality in PCAC.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nQuantitative brain diffusion imaging analyses has the potential to improve multimodal neurological prognostication and prevent false\\npositive prediction of poor outcomes in patients who may recover from PCAC.\\n\\nSSNR03-05 Deep Learning-based Fully Automated Detection and Quantification of Acute Infarcts\\n\\nParticipants\\nSeung Hyun Hwang, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nHyug-Gi Kim, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nHwiyoung Kim, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nKyung Mi Lee, MD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJihoon Cha, MD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Research funded, DEEPNOID, Inc\\nJa Ho Koo, MD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Research funded, DEEPNOID, Inc\\nHyun S.

A deep learning-based\\nautomated infarct segmentation model on diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) was developed, and infarct severity with respect to\\napparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) map was measured.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nDWIs and ADC maps from 394 patients with acute infarct were collected from a single institution, from January 2015 to May 2019.\\nTotal dataset was divided into three subsets; 216 for training, 24 for validation, 154 for test purposes. A convolutional neural\\nnetwork (CNN) based encoder-decoder model (specifically, modified 2D U-Net) was trained to segment the infarct lesion on DWIs.\\nAn ensemble approach was employed to get a better performance on small lesions. The infarct severity w.r.t ADC values were\\nmeasured within predicted lesions and stratified to four categories according to ADC value (no stroke symptoms, minor stroke,\\nmoderate stroke, severe stroke). The segmentation performance was evaluated in terms of dice coefficient, and compared with U-\\nNet. The lesion volume estimated by our model was compared to that manually derived by radiologists.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nOur model achieved dice coefficient superior to U-Net. Dice coefficient was 0.8440 for our model, and 0.8233 for U-Net. After\\nensemble approach, our model scored 0.8575 in test dataset with standard deviation (SD) of 0.0657 (0.8944 ± 0.1783 SD with\\nexcluding outliers). The ensemble model showed 83 % sensitivity, and 99 % specificity. Average volume difference between the\\nlesions estimated by our model and those by radiologists was 0.2531 ml. The ADC value of >620 was set as a cutoff for \\'no stroke\\nsymptoms\\' category, and the other categories were determined at 100 intervals in terms of ADC value.

A senior radiologist with over 10\\nyears\\' experience reviewed reports for inclusion. Two separate screeners independently reviewed all included studies, performed\\nfull-text screen and extracted data from the final studies.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe literature search returned a total of 4,338 results. After de-duplication, the abstracts of 2,652 manuscripts were screened\\nresulting in 189 papers identified for full-text screening. Finally a total of 23 studies published since 01/01/2019 with 2,244 patients\\nwere included in the final analysis. The pooled proportions from all 23 studies of good outcomes after thrombectomy was 31.4% and\\n33.3% in the fixed- and random-effects models respectively, with a range from 15.0% to 64.3%. The pooled risk of mortality after\\nthrombectomy was 32.8% in fixed-effects model and 29.8% in the random-effects model, with a range from 9.5% to 46.2%.\\nSubgroup analysis with 3 prospective studies showed a pooled rate of excellent outcomes (mRS 0-1) of 20.8% in both the fixed-\\nand random-effects models.

We developed radiomics models derived from pre- and post-treatment MRI to predict survival outcomes of patients with\\nglioblastoma on PD-L1 inhibition immunotherapy.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThis is a post-hoc study of 113 patients with glioblastoma from a multicenter trial (NCT02336165) assessing the efficacy of\\ndurvalumab (monoclonal antibody against PD-L1) with or without radiation or bevacizumab. T2-FLAIR-hyperintense and enhancing\\ntumor volumes of interest (VOI) were segmented from pre- and immediate post-treatment MRI, and 10 shape, 72 histogram, and\\n160 texture features (total 484 imaging features) were extracted. A random forest algorithm was applied to data (radiomic\\nfeatures, treatment arm, and demographics) from a subset of sites to train a model to predict long overall survival (OS) and\\nprogression free survival (PFS) followed by testing on the data from the remaining sites (Table). Model performance was assessed\\nusing area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Radiomic score threshold was defined to maximize sensitivity\\nand specificity. Cox proportional hazard and Kaplan Meier analyses were performed on the testing data.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe study cohort mean age was 55.2 ± 11.5 years and was majority male (69%). The median PFS was 106 days (IQR: 56-150.5\\ndays) and median OS was 207.5 days (IQR: 150.5-393.5 days). Pre-treatment MRI features alone had poor predictive value for OS\\nand PFS. Post-treatment MRI features had high predictive value for OS (AUC=0.74-0.84 in training and AUC=0.71-86 in testing\\ncohort, Figure) and PFS (AUC=0.64-0.72 in training and AUC=0.73-0.78 in testing cohort). Higher post-treatment MRI based\\nradiomic score was associated with shorter OS (HR:2.63-6.49) and shorter PFS (HR:3.29-5.67) in the testing cohort (Figure).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nWe developed and validated a radiomics-based ML model for prediction of long OS and PFS from multi-center immediate post-\\ntreatment MRI in patients with glioblastoma on PD-L1 inhibition immunotherapy.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nRadiomics and ML derived imaging-based model from multi-center post-treatment MRI can identify long survivors and responders in\\npatients with GBM on PD-L1 inhibition immunotherapy.\\n\\n\\x0cSSNR10-03 Voxel-Wise and Patient-Wise Correlation of 18F-FDOPA PET and Physiologic MRI in Treatment-Naïve\\n\\nDiffuse Gliomas with Different Molecular Subtypes\\n\\nParticipants\\nHiroyuki Tatekawa, MD, Los Angeles, CA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nAkifumi Hagiwara, MD, Tokyo, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJingwen Yao, MBBS,MS, Los Angeles, CA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nTalia C.

Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity area was segmented and used as a\\nregion-of-interest. For voxel-wise and patient-wise analyses, Pearson\\'s correlation coefficients (rvoxel-wise and rpatient-wise)\\nbetween normalized SUV (nSUV), rCBV, and ADC were evaluated. Cox regression analysis was performed to investigate the\\nassociations between overall survival (OS) and the rvoxel-wise, max/median nSUV, median CBV, or median ADC.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nFor IDHwt and IDHm-non-codel gliomas, nSUV demonstrated significant positive correlations with rCBV (rvoxel-wise = 0.25 and\\n0.31, and rpatient-wise = 0.50 and 0.70, respectively), and negative correlations with ADC (rvoxel-wise = -0.19 and -0.19, and\\nrpatient-wise = -0.58 and -0.61, respectively) in both voxel-wise and patient-wise analyses. IDHm-codel gliomas only\\ndemonstrated a significant correlation between nSUV and ADC in voxel-wise analysis (rvoxel-wise = 0.18). In the Cox regression\\nanalysis, only rvoxel-wise between nSUV and rCBV (hazard ratio (HR) = 28.82) or ADC (HR = 0.085) had significant associations\\nwith OS for IDHwt.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIDHm-codel gliomas showed unique patterns of correlations between amino acid PET and physiologic MRI. Stronger correlation of\\nnSUV and rCBV or ADC may result in worse prognosis in IDHwt.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThe correlation of physiologic images in IDHm-codel gliomas was different from that in IDHwt or IDHm-non-codel gliomas, reflecting\\nthe unique heterogeneous oligo-components.\\n\\nSSNR10-04 Functional Connectivity Profile of Solid Tumor Predicts Overall Survival in Patients with Gliomas\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Resident\\n\\nParticipants\\nGiulia Sprugnoli, MD, Sinalunga, Italy (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nLaura Rigolo, BA,MA, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nMeghan J.

To explore the\\nfunctional integration between solid tumor and healthy brain tissue in humans, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance\\nimaging (rs-fMRI).\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\n54 patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent glioma were included. Lesions were manually segmented (Fig1A, neurological\\nconvention) and rs-fMRI was analyzed via seed-to-voxel analysis using the solid tumor mask as seed region, and interpreted\\naccording to known topologies of Resting-State fMRI Networks (RSN). A regression model between Functional Connectivity (FC) of\\nthe solid tumor with respect to the rest of the brain and overall survival (OS) was performed (covariates: age and gender).\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nSolid tumor masks of newly diagnosed gliomas (n=18) displayed a pattern of significant FC with occipital cortices and bifrontal\\nregions (p<0.05; Fig1B), overlapping with the Fronto-Parietal Control Network, Ventral Attention Network (VAN) and the Visual\\nNetwork (Fig1B). Recurrent gliomas (n=36) showed FC with bilateral fronto-parietal regions (p<0.05), overlapping with VAN and\\nDorsal Attention Network (DAN)(Fig1D). Highly significant (p<0.001) predictors were obtained for FC of solid tumor and: (i) bilateral\\nfrontal (r=0.96; OS variance explained by FC, R2=92%) and (ii) right occipito-temporal regions (r=0.90; OS variance explained by\\nFC, R2=82%) in newly diagnosed high-grade gliomas (HGG; Fig1C); (iii) right frontal areas in HGG patients at recurrence (r=0.72; OS\\nvariance explained by FC, R2=52%)(Fig1D). FC patterns of multiple control regions, e.g. S1, did not show any significant relation in\\nboth groups (Fig1C-D). A regression model including FC predictors and clinical (e.g., KPS, tumor size) and demographic ones (age,\\ngender) highlighted tumor-to-brain FC as the best absolutely predictor of survival, outperforming age and genetic profile (IDH-\\nstatus) by a factor of 2.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nWe found significant FC between solid tumor and healthy brain structures, resembling well-known RSN. Moreover, the FC profile of\\nsolid tumor predicts OS in both newly diagnosed and recurrent HGG, possibly reflecting the recently postulated integration of\\ngliomas into brain network responsible of HGG aggressiveness.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nFunctional imaging could help deepen our understanding of glioma pathophysiology and guide development of new therapies.\\n\\nSSNR10-05 Diffusion MRI With Spherical B-Tensor Encoding Increases Glioma Tumor Conspicuity\\n\\nParticipants\\nJan Brabec, MD, Lund, Sweden (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nFilip Szczepankiewicz, PhD, Lund, Sweden (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nPatrik Brynolfsson, Lund, Sweden (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nBjorn Lampinen, Lund, Sweden (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nNatalia Ondkova, Wels, Austria (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nFaris Durmo, Lund, Sweden (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nAnna Rydelius, Lund, Sweden (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nLinda Knutsson, Lund, Sweden (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nPia C.

LTE corresponds to conventional diffusion encoding. STE is insensitive to the shape of microscopic structures and\\nenables separation of the anisotropic (MKA) and isotropic (MKI) components of the total kurtosis. Regions in gliomas exhibiting high\\nsignal at b=2.0 ms/μm2 (i.e. characterized by \\'reduced diffusivity\\') were delineated on the co-registered STE and LTE images and\\ncontralateral normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) on co-registered post-Gd T1w MPRAGE images. Signal-intensity ratios (SIR)\\nbetween the regions and NAWM were calculated for both LTE and STE images where only those with SIR>1.2 were further\\nconsidered as \\'enhancing\\'.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nOut of 45 glioma examinations, 23 (51 %), 22 (47 %) and 26 (58 %) were enhancing on Gd-T1w-, LTE- and STE-images,\\nrespectively. Across all cases, the SIR for enhancing regions was significantly higher for STE than for LTE (medians 1.8 vs. 1.4;\\np<10-4; Wilcoxon signed rank test). Moreover, in 10 cases (corresponding to 40 %), the SIR for STE was above 2 but none of the\\nLTE cases reached such high contrast. That is because the majority (62 %) of total kurtosis of enhancing regions in gliomas is\\nattributed to the isotropic component (MKI=0.67, MKA=0.4) whereas the majority (76 %) in white matter to the anisotropic\\ncomponent (MKI=0.29, MKA=0.98). In the figure, part A shows a glioma with enhancing region (yellow arrow) that is more visible on\\nSTE than LTE (SIR=1.4 vs. 1.1; within the slice). Part B compares the SIR for all cases. Part C shows a non-enhancing glioma. In\\nthe STE image, the signal from white matter tracts (red arrows) is suppressed making the tumor (yellow arrows) more visible.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nB-tensor encoding enables more specific assessment of enhancing regions (high signal at high b-values) and produces higher\\n\\n\\x0ccontrast to white matter for tissues with a high isotropic component such as in glioma tumors.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThis could improve detection, reduce scan times, and benefit planning of pre-operative biopsy or post-surgical radiation and its\\nevaluation.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSNR11\\n\\nNeuroradiology/Head and Neck (Head and Neck Tumor Imaging)\\n\\nW ednesday, Dec. 2 5:00PM - 6:00PM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nGI US\\n\\nVA OI\\n\\nIR AI\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .50\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSNR11-01 Subtraction Iodine Imaging Using Area Detector CT for Improving Tumor Delineation and\\n\\nMeasurability of Size and Depth of Invasion in Tongue Squamous Cell Carcinoma\\n\\nParticipants\\nTakashi Hiyama, MD, Kashiwa, Japan (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nHirofumi Kuno, MD, PhD, Kashiwa, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nShioto Oda, MD, Kashiwa, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nTatsushi Kobayashi, MD, Kashiwa, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nmedtak39@gmail.com\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTumor size (TS) and depth of invasion (DOI) are essential for the T classification of tongue cancers but cannot often be assessed\\non CT because of dental artifacts. Subtraction iodine imaging (SII) may accelerate contrast enhancement and reduce artifacts.\\nThe aim of this study was to investigate whether adding SII to CT improves tumor delineation and measurability or not.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nAfter institutional review board approval, we enrolled 59 consecutive patients (37 men, 22 women; median age, 63 years) who\\nunderwent contrast-enhanced CT using 320-row area detector CT and 3.0 T MRI for tongue cancer and were treated with surgical\\nresection. CT images were reconstructed with single-energy projection-based metallic artifact reduction. SII was generated by\\nsubtracting the pre- and post-contrast volume scans reconstructed using a high-resolution deformable registration algorithm. Two\\nblinded radiologists visually graded tumor delineation on a 5-point scale (1 = definitely invisible; 2 = probably invisible; 3 = partially\\nvisible; 4 = mostly visible; 5 = wholly visible) on CTs, CT-plus-SII, and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI with fat suppression\\n(CET1WI). Score 3-5 were defined as detectable. TS and DOI were measured in measurable cases. Tumor delineation scores were\\ncompared using the Wilcoxon rank method. Correlation between the TS/DOI of each modality and those of pathology were\\nevaluated using Spearman\\'s correlation.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe tumor delineation score was highest for CET1WI, followed by CT-plus-SII and CT (medians: 4, 3, and 1, respectively, p\\n<0.001). Detectability and measurability of CT-plus-SII were superior to those of CT (36/59 [61%] vs 21/59 [36%] for\\ndetectability, 27/59 [46%] vs 17/59 [29%] for measurability), although MRI had the highest detectability (53/59 [90%]) and\\nmeasurability (47/59 [80%]). The correlation of radiological and pathological TS/DOI was similar among modalities (0.83-0.88 on CT;\\n0.81-0.84 on CT-plus-SII; 0.79-0.90 on MRI).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nAdding SII to CT may improve delineation of tongue cancers and measurability of TS and DOI, although MRI is superior. The\\ncorrelation of SII with pathological measurement is no less than that of MRI.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nAdding SII to CT increases the number of diagnosable T-classifications of tongue cancers and may be beneficial for patients with\\ncontraindications for MRI.\\n\\nSSNR11-02 Using Radiomics and Machine Learning to Predict CD8+ T Cell Enrichment in Primary Head and Neck\\n\\nSquamous Cell Carcinoma\\n\\nParticipants\\nColin Wang, BA, Chicago, IL (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nDaniel Ginat, MD, Chicago, IL (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\ncolin.wang@uchospitals.edu\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nThe purpose of this study is to assess whether a machine learning model constructed from radiomic analysis of standard-of-care CT\\nimaging can predict CD8+ T-cell enrichment in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) primary tumors.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThis retrospective study included 71 patients from a head and neck cancer genomics cohort. In order to identify tumors with CD8+\\n\\n\\x0cT-cell enrichment, a 12-gene chemokine gene expression signature consisting of chemokine CCl2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, CCL8, CCL18,\\nCCL19, CCL21, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11 and CXCL13 was implemented. Tumors with CD8+ T-cell enrichment based on this signature\\nwere defined as having a high T-cell-inflamed phenotype (TCIP-H), whereas tumors with no CD8+ T-cell enrichment was defined as\\nhaving a low T-cell-inflamed phenotype (TCIP-L). Pre-treatment contrast-enhanced soft tissue neck CT scans were retrospectively\\nreviewed using 3D Slicer (slicer.org) for primary lesion segmentation. The SlicerRadiomics extension\\n(http://PyRadiomics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) was used to extract 107 features. Ridge regression and lasso regression were\\napplied for feature selection and model construction. Receiver operating characteristic curves were generated and the areas under\\nthe curve (AUC) for these models were compared.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nOf the 71 total primary tumors, 38 were located in the oropharynx, 15 in the oral cavity, 14 in the larynx, and 4 in the\\nhypopharynx. Lasso regression defined Coarseness as the most important variable, followed by SmallDependenceEmphasis,\\nSmallAreaLowGrayLevelEmphasis, Contrast.1, and Correlation. Ridge regression defined Coarseness as the most important variable,\\nfollowed by SmallDependenceLowGrayLevelEmphasis, Contrast.1, DependenceNonUniformityNormalized, and Idmn. These variables\\nidentified by lasso and ridge regression were used to create a combined logistic regression model and assessed separately. The AUC\\nfor the lasso-generated model was 0.786 (95% CI, 0.532-1.000) and the AUC for the ridge-generated model was 0.786 (95% CI,\\n0.544-1.000). The AUC for the combined model was 0.643 (95% CI, 0.340-0.946).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe T-cell inflammation properties of HNSCC primary tumors can be predicted using radiomic analysis of standard-of-care CT\\nimaging.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nRadiomic analysis of standard-of-care CT imaging may be used to help identify patients with HNSCC that would respond well to\\nimmunotherapy.\\n\\nSSNR11-05 Comparison of Thyroid Risk Categorization Systems and Biopsy Recommendations in a Multi-\\n\\ninstitutional Thyroid Ultrasound Registry\\n\\nParticipants\\nJenny K.

In these studies, the American College of Radiology (ACR) TI-RADS biopsy recommendation rate (BRR) is 55% compared to\\n70 to 83% for other guidelines. We hypothesized that the difference would be even greater if the BRR was assessed for all nodules\\ndetected on ultrasound. This study aimed to compare the ACR TI-RADS biopsy recommendation rate with other guidelines for\\nnodules reported on diagnostic thyroid ultrasound.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\n7 radiology practices prospectively submitted thyroid ultrasound reports to the ACR TI-RADS registry between October 2018 and\\nMarch 2020 for low-risk patients undergoing routine thyroid sonography. Data were collected using a structured reporting template\\nwith fields for ACR TI-RADS\\' five ultrasound categories plus nodule size.The nodules were categorized according to criteria from ACR\\nTI-RADS, the American Thyroid Association guidelines (ATA), European TI-RADS (EU-TIRADS) and Korean TI-RADS (K-TIRADS) to\\ncompare BRRs.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nComplete data were available in 33687 nodules in 13600 patients. The median size was 1.2 cm. ACR TI-RADS classified 47%, 30%,\\nand 8% of nodules as TR4, TR3, and TR5, respectively (Table 1). The distribution of risk categories for ATA, EU-TIRADS, and K-\\nTIRADS was similar. ACR TI-RADS recommended 8773 (26%) biopsies, which was the lowest BRR (Table 1). Recommended biopsies\\nby ATA, European TIRADS, and Korean TIRADS were 17421 (52%), 11681 (35%), 19224 (57%) and 16857 (50%), respectively. The\\nproportion of TR3 and TR4 nodules that were recommended for biopsy was lower for ACR TI-RADS compared to other systems at\\n18% and 30%, respectively. At the high suspicion level (TR5), the BRR was similar for all guidelines at 65-71%.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe distribution of nodules in risk categories are similar for all systems, but ACR TI-RADS recommends 25-50% fewer biopsies\\nbecause it has higher biopsy size thresholds in the TR3 and TR4 categories.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nWhen ACR TI-RADS is applied to low-risk patients undergoing routine thyroid sonography, the biopsy recommendation rate is 26%,\\nand 25-50% less compared to other risk categorization systems.\\n\\n\\x0cSSNR11-06 Characterization of Head and Neck Paragangliomas by Multiparametric MR Imaging: A Comparison\\n\\nwith Other Deep Soft-tissue Tumors of the Neck\\n\\nParticipants\\nEmina Arsovic, Paris, France (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nSamia Akkari, Marseille, France (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nUgo Scemama, Marseille, France (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nMarion Montava, Marseille, France (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJean-Pierre Lavieille, Marseille, France (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nNicolas Fakhry, Marseille CEDEX 5, France (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nDavid Taieb, Marseille, France (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nArthur D.

A retrospective review of 50 patients with head and neck paragangliomas\\n(HNPGL) evaluated by both 18F-DOPA PET/CT, and time-resolved MRA sequences, between 2009-2019 was performed. A control\\ngroup of 33 patients, investigated during the same period, was also analyzed, including nerve sheath tumors, metastatic lymph\\nnodes from squamous cell carcinomas or from UCNT, arterio-venous malformations, and temporal bone meningiomas. MR parameters\\nwere extracted from dynamic contrast enhancement (DCE) sequences and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) was assessed for each\\nlesion. The image quality of DCE was scaled (1-3). A gold standard was obtained for all cases.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nSixty lesions HNPGL lesions were included, 20 with germline mutations in one of the SDH genes (SDHx) and compared to 36 vascular\\nspace lesions. All semi-quantitative parameters extracted from time intensity-curves were significantly different between HNPGL\\nand other vascular space tumors, including wash-in obtained par linear regression, time-to-peak, and wash-out. Nerve sheath\\ntumours exhibited higher ADC values than lymph nodes. Classification and a regression tree (CART) distinguished HNPGL from other\\ntumors with a high accuracy. The features were also shown and formed distinct groups on principal component analysis. No\\nsignificant difference was observed between sporadic and SDHx mutated HNPGL.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nOur study identifies a multiparametric MRI signature of paragangliomas that provides a strong impetus for switching from qualitative\\nto quantitative analysis of deep soft-tissue tumors of the neck.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nMultiparametric MRI signature of paragangliomas provides a strong impetus for switching from qualitative to quantitative analysis of\\ndeep soft-tissue tumors of the neck.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSNR14\\n\\nNeuroradiology (Neuro Spine Imaging)\\n\\nThursday, Dec. 3 8:30AM - 9:30AM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nCT\\n\\nPH\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .50\\n\\nFDA  Discussions may include off-label uses.\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSNR14-01 Early Renal Pelvis Opacification on Postmyelography-CT as an Indicator for Increased CSF\\n\\nResorption in Spontaneous Intracranial Hypotension\\n\\nParticipants\\nEike I.

Twenty non-SIH\\npatients served as controls. PMCT images from all patients were evaluated for renal pelvis density in Hounsfield units (HU).\\nAdditionalnumber of meningeal cysts, and the presence of the hyperdense paraspinal vein were analysed.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nOf the 111 SIH patients 71 (64%) presented with an SLEC and 40 (36%) without. The adjusted renal pelvis density was\\nsignificantly higher in suspected SIH in both groups (SLEC (+) and SLEC (-)) than in non-SIH controls (absolute difference: 75 and\\n50 HU respectively; both p<0.001). There was a tendency to higher renal pelvis density in the SLEC (+) group compared to the\\nSLEC (-) group but these differences were not significant. No CSF-venous fistulas were found.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIncreased renal opacification of contrast was observed in SIH patients, both with and without epidural CSF collection. In the latter,\\nrenal opacification may be considered a surrogate for increased CSF resorption. Whether CSF-venous fistulas occult to imaging or\\nincreased resorption via spinal arachnoid granulations may be the underlying pathology remains unclear.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nSpinal CSF loss as the reason for spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) has multiple reasons. It is widely believed that SIH is\\nmost commonly triggered by CSF leakage from the intrathecal into the epidural compartment. This is usually due to an\\nosteodiscogenic microspur (calcified disc protrusion or spondylophyte) penetrating the dura, or less frequently to a rupture of a\\nspinal nerve root diverticulum. Alternative pathomechanisms like the CSF venous fistula, may also be demonstrated on imaging. But\\nthere are still patients with the classic appearance of SIH, clinically and in imaging, where neither one of these two entities could\\nbe demonstrated. We hypothesize that another form of CSF loss exists besides a dural leak and a CSF-venous fistula, an increased\\nCSF resorption possibly via spinal arachnoid granulations.\\n\\nSpecial Note\\n\\nThis paper has received the Kuo York Chynn Neuroradiology Research Award.

The presumed optimal therapy is\\nimaging-guided targeted epidural blood and fibrin glue patching. Despite widespread adoption, the efficacy of this procedure remains\\nuncertain without any randomized controlled trials (RCT). The purpose of this study was to determine if randomization and blinding\\nare feasible for a sham RCT in SIH.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThis feasibility sham RCT employed a single-center, parallel, blinded, crossover design. Patients were screened from 12/17-10/19.\\nInclusion criteria: 1) adult, 2) met ICHD-3 criteria for SIH, 3) prior brain MRI, 4) HIT-6 score>56, 5) myelogram positive for CSF\\nleak. Exclusion criteria: 1) recent blood patch, 2) allergy to contrast/fibrin glue, 3) inability to consent/follow up, 4) pregnancy.\\nParticipants were assigned 1:1 using block randomization to either: 1) CT fluoroscopy-guided targeted blood and fibrin glue\\npatching, or 2) a simulated procedure without patching. Patients and outcome assessors were blinded. Effectiveness of blinding\\nwas assessed via Bang Blinding Index. Participant data and outcome measures were obtained at baseline and at 2 weeks, 1 month,\\nand 4 months after the procedure. Primary outcome measure was HIT-6 at 1 month. Crossover rate between arms was assessed.\\nBrain MRI at 2 months was compared with baseline to assess for changes in SIH signs using the Dombrocky score. T-test statistics\\nwere used.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\n584 were screened, 83 met eligibility criteria, 68 declined to participate, 15(18.1% eligible) were enrolled and randomized (Fig). 47%\\n(7/15) of participants did not know their intervention arm. Of the 53%(8/15) that guessed, 75%(6/8) were incorrect. 100%(7/7) in\\nthe sham arm crossed over vs. 0%(0/8) in the patch arm (p<0.001). No patients were lost to follow up prior to the primary\\noutcome. Mean reduction in HIT-6 at 1 month was 11.5(+-5.5) in the patch arm vs. 7.9(+-7.2) sham (p=0.29). Mean reduction in\\nMRI Dombrocky score was 4.3(+-3.5) points in the patch arm vs. 1(+-4.3) in sham (p=0.15).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nRandomization and blinding were successful for the PATCH feasibility trial. These results will form the basis for a future definitive\\nmulticenter RCT.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThere are currently no RCTs determining the efficacy of epidural blood patching in SIH. This study confirms the feasibility of the\\nplanned multi-center RCT designed to meet that need.\\n\\nSSNR14-03 Longitudinal Comparison of Radiologists and Other Specialists in the Performance of Lumbar\\n\\nPuncture Procedures\\n\\nParticipants\\nDerek R.

Lumbar puncture\\nprocedures were classified by billing physician specialty, day of week (weekday vs weekend), and patient complexity (using the\\nCharlson comorbidity index). Statistical analysis included Pearson chi-square and independent samples t-tests.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nBetween 2005 and 2017, 34,408 lumbar puncture procedures were identified. Over this period, the percentage of all lumbar\\npunctures performed by radiologists increased from 40% to 54%, while the percentages performed by emergency medicine\\nphysicians fell from 19% to 15% and by neurologists and neurosurgeons together fell from 25% to 15%. In 2017, radiologists\\nperformed the majority of lumbar punctures on weekdays (56%) and a plurality of those performed on weekends (38%). Radiologists\\nperformed the majority of lumbar punctures in high-complexity patients each year, and the proportion of all procedures in complex\\npatients performed by radiologists increased from 44% to 56% over the study period.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nRadiologists are performing an increasing percentage of lumbar puncture procedures in the Medicare population.

A recent study published on horses with EDS demonstrated\\nabnormalities in myodural bridge collagen via histology and transmission electron microscopy. The purpose of this study was to\\nevaluate the feasibility of performing ultrasound (US) of cervical spine subarachnoid (SA) space in humans and evaluate for possible\\ndifference in patients with connective tissue disorder (CTD).\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nTwenty healthy controls and 20 patients with CTD were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included severe cervical spine abnormalities,\\nChiari malformation or decompression, active CSF leak, history of idiopathic intracranial hypertension or hydrocephalus. All\\nparticipants were screened using the Beighton score for joint hypermobility. US was performed at the atlanto-axial level with the\\nhead and neck positioned in neutral (90°), flexion (54°), and extension (105°). The width of the SA space was measured 3 times in\\neach position by a single radiologist.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe SA space was more likely to be wider in extension than neutral in the control population vs. CTD population (P<.001). The\\ncontrol population demonstrated a 21.0% increase in SA space from neutral to extension, while the CTD population had a 1.1%\\ndecrease in SA size (P=.022). Controls had an average Beighton score of 1.05, while the average score for CTD patients was 6.0\\n(P<.001). Increased Beighton scores were associated with a decreased absolute change in SA width when moving from neutral to\\nextension (P=.022).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThis study demonstrates the SA space at the atlanto-axial level does not increase in extension in patients with CTD as it does in\\ncontrol patients without CTD. This may be secondary to increased laxity of the myodural bridges in extension in patients with CTD.\\nFurther study is needed to determine the role of altered myodural bridge dynamics in chronic headache in the CTD population.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nUltrasound can be used for dynamic assessment of the atlanto-axial subarachnoid space. Additionally, this study is the first to\\nsuggest functional evidence of altered myodural bridge dynamics in the human CTD population, specifically dural in-folding in head\\nextension.\\n\\nSSNR14-06 Deep Learning-Based Radiomics Can Predict the Neurological Prognosis of Acute Cervical Spinal Cord\\n\\nInjury\\n\\nParticipants\\nSho Okimatsu, MD, Chiba, Japan (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nSatoshi Maki, MD,PhD, Chiba, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\ns.okimatsu@icloud.com\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nAcute traumatic cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) has a devastating impact on patients\\' lives and there is a great need for\\nprognostic biomarkers in the acute phase. It is challenging to predict neurological outcomes of acute SCI considering the spinal\\nshock and heterogeneous nature of the injury. It\\'s inconclusive if certain MRI characteristics in SCI can predict neurologic\\noutcomes. Deep learning-based radiomics (DLR) were developed to quantify radiographic characteristics automatically using\\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN) and potentially permit the prognostic stratification of patients. The purpose of this study was\\nto assess the ability of DLR to predict the neurological prognosis of patients with cervical SCI.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nWe retrospectively reviewed data from patients with cervical SCI who had undergone MRI within 24 hours after injury and whose\\nAmerican spinal cord injury association Impairment Scale (AIS) at 1 month after injury was known. Exclusion criteria were death,\\nand cases with thoracolumbar spinal cord injury or impaired consciousness. A total of 217 patients were enrolled and 284 MR images\\ncollected. Patients whose AIS was A or B were analyzed altogether due to the small number of cases with these scores. Sagittal\\nT2-weighted images were used for the CNN training and validation. MR imaging protocols were not standardized for each medical\\ncenter. The deep learning framework Tensorflow was used to construct the CNN architecture. The concordance rate between the\\nAIS predicted by DLR and the actual AIS was evaluated by 5-fold cross validation using a quadratic Cohen\\'s weighted Κ coefficient.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe number of patients whose AIS at 1 month after injury was A/B, C, D, and E was 29, 46, 90 and 51, respectively (Table. 1).\\nTable. 2 shows the confusion matrix of the ground truth and predicted AIS. One hundred and thirty-one out of 284 (46.1%) MRI\\nimages were predicted correctly and 249 out of 284 (87.7%) images were predictable within one off from the correct AIS. The\\nweighted Κ coefficient between the actual and predicted AIS was 0.52, which indicates moderate agreement.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe present study demonstrates that prediction of the short-term neurological prognosis of acute cervical spinal cord injury using\\n\\n\\x0cDLR is feasible.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nDeep learning-based radiomics using MRI images can robustly predict neurological prognosis of acute cervical spinal cord injury.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSNR16\\n\\nScience Session with Keynote: Neuroradiology/Head and Neck (Neuro AI: Image Interpretation)\\n\\nSaturday, Dec. 5 2:00PM - 3:00PM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nCH CT MR OI\\n\\nSQ AI\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .75\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSNR16-01 Neuroradiology Keynote Speaker: AI in Neuroradiology, Are We There Yet?\\n\\nParticipants\\nKambiz Nael, MD, Los Angeles, CA (Presenter) Medical Advisory Board, Canon Medical Systems Corporation\\n\\nSSNR16-02 Longitudinal Transfer Learning-based Machine Learning for Diagnosis and Prognosis on Mild\\n\\nCognitive Impairment Patients for Alzheimer\\'s Disease with Incomplete Multi-Modality Imaging Data\\n\\nParticipants\\nJing Li, PhD, Atlanta, GA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nTeresa Wu, Gilbert, AZ (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nKewei Chen, PhD, Tucson, AZ (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nDave Weidman, MD, Tucson, AZ (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nYi Su, PhD, Tucson, AZ (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nFleming Y.

We developed a novel\\nlongitudinal transfer learning-based machine learning model (LML) for incomplete multi-modality images at baseline and follow-up.\\nThis study investigates the efficacy of LML for diagnosis and prognosis of MCI.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\n214 MCI patients from ADNI database were included: 97 MCI due to AD, 26 and 46 MCI converting to AD within 2 and 6 years,\\nrespectively. Patients were divided into four sub-cohorts based on the imaging available: MRI only; MRI & FDG-PET; MRI & Amyloid-\\nPET; and all three modalities. Based on expectation-maximization statistics to estimate common parameters to facilitate knowledge\\ntransfer learning (TL), we developed an LML model to train with incomplete longitudinal multi-modality imaging to avoid the negative\\ntransfer for diagnosis and prognosis of MCI due to AD for up to 6 years. We also compared the results with a separate model (SM)\\nof each cohort using logistic regression only.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nFor diagnosis of MCI due to AD at baseline, 87 out of 214MCI were Amyloid-beta positive at baseline. LML achieved 0.89 area under\\nthe curve (AUC), 0.91 sensitivity (SN), and 0.88 specificity (SP). This is a significant improvement over baseline images without TL.\\nFor prognosis of MCI at baseline during 2-year conversion, 26 out of 214 converted to AD, LML achieved 0.83, 0.82, and 0.90 for\\nAUC, SN, and SP, respectively, for this heavily imbalance dataset; whereas SM model achieved 0.79, 0.43, and 0.95 for AUC, SN,\\nand SP, respectively. For prognosis during 6-year conversion, LML achieved 0.83 AUC, 0.92 SN, and 0.85 SP for predicting the\\nconversion. Using longitudinal images, the performance of LML improved to 0.86 AUC, 0.94 SN, and 0.88 SP.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nWe successfully developed a novel LML to diagnose and prognose MCI with varying availability of imaging modalities from MRI, FDG-\\nPET, and Amyloid-PET. The LML achieved much better accuracy than the competing model, using each cohort for the diagnosis and\\nprognosis.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThe results demonstrate that the longitudinal transfer learning-based machine learning model can assist physicians to improve early\\ndiagnosis and early detection of AD from multi-modality imaging, even when some modalities may be missing.\\n\\nSSNR16-03 Deep Movement: Deep Learning of Movie Files to Aid Management in Endovascular Thrombectomy\\n\\nParticipants\\nBrendan Kelly, BMBCh, Dublin, Ireland (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nEdward H.

Endovascular thrombectomy has\\nrevolutionized treatment and improved outcomes. \"Time is Brain\" and measures that can increase the speed of the diagnostic and\\ntreatment processes have the potential to improve patient outcomes.We developed a deep learning model that can accept video\\nfiles of Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) of the anterior cerebral circulation and (1) classify according to the presence or\\nabsence of Large Vessel Occlusion (LVO) including M2 (2) classify the location of the occlusion and (3) assess the effect of\\nreperfusion therapy.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nIn this single center retrospective study all patients who underwent DSA for acute ischaemic stroke between 2012 and 2019 were\\nincluded for analysis. Consecutive normal studies were also included to balance classes. A 2.5D deep convolutional network\\n(Xception) was trained and tested to classify DSA videos in mp4 format. Modified Treatment In Cerebral Ischaemia (mTICI) scores\\nwere recorded and the trained model was then used on the post thrombectomy videos to identify a successful thrombectomy and\\ngrade the outcome.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\n1024 total videos comprising 287 patients were included for analysis (225 with occlusion and 62 normal, 237 for training and 50 for\\ntesting). Occlusion identification was achieved with 100% Sensitivity (CI 90.75% to 100.00%) and 91.67% Specificity (CI 61.52%\\nto 99.79%). Accuracy of location classification was 71% for ICA, 84% for M1 and 78% for M2 occlusions. Analyzing videos post\\nthrombectomy (n=194) the model identified successful reperfusion with 100% accuracy for ICA occlusions and 88% for M1 but only\\n35% for M2 occlusion.

The purpose of this study was to develop convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify frontoparietal\\n(FP) network (FPN) and laterality in rs-fMRI performed in patients with FP brain tumors.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\n45 consecutive patients with FP brain tumors (low & high-grade gliomas) who underwent preoperative fMRI for language localization\\nand 42 healthy controls matched by age were enrolled. Independent component analysis (ICA) components were calculated using\\nFSL MELODIC using either the first 3 minutes or first 6 minutes of rs-fMRI data, to determine whether shorter imaging acquisition\\ncould generate similar results.FPN identification: Sum projection map from 3 orientations (red - axial, green - sagittal, blue -\\ncoronal) of ICA components from healthy subjects\\' rs-fMRI were used to train and test VGG16-based CNNs to classify left-FPN,\\nright-FPN, or not-FPN. External testing was performed on the 45 FP tumor rs-fMRI and task-fMRI (sentence completion).Laterality\\ncategorization: Task-fMRI of tumor patients were used to create ICA maps of FPN (both left & right FPN combined) and labelled as\\nleft lateralized or otherwise (right/bilateral), which were used to train VGG16-based CNNs and tested on resting state ICA maps of\\nFPN.Test performance was determined with area under ROC curve (AUC) and compared using DeLong method.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe best-performing CNNs for FPN and laterality identification had AUCs of 0.98 & 0.75, respectively, on internal hold-out test set\\nof healthy subjects\\' images with no significant difference between 3 & 6 minute acquisitions.

Exams were split into segmentation (n=200) and classification (n=192)\\nsets. The segmentation set was divided for training (n=153) and testing (n=47). Manual delineation and labelling of TNs by two\\nexpert radiologists was the reference standard. The 2D U-Net architecture was adopted for automated cine loop segmentation and\\nits performance was compared with manual segmentation using the Dice similarity coefficient and interquartile range (IQR). For\\nthyroid nodule malignancy prediction, two deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) were trained (n=132, 92 benign, 40\\nmalignant), validated (n=40, 28 benign, 12 malignant) and tested (n=20, 15 benign, 5 malignant) on the separate classification\\ndataset. After an optimal representative single still image was selected by a radiologist for each cine loop the TNs were segmented\\non cine loops and selected static images using the FCN model above and classified as benign or malignant. The classification models\\nwere assessed by receiver operating characteristic curves and areas under the curve (AUCs).\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nIn the test cohort for TN segmentation, the Dice similarity coefficient was 0.790 (IQR: 0.711-0.903) between the automated\\nmethod and manual delineation. For classification, DCNN models for cine loops and static images with best validation accuracies of\\n0.872 and 0.767 were used for testing and evaluation. The cine loop classifier performed significantly better compared to the static\\nimage classifier (AUC: 0.833, 0.758-0.901 vs. 0.700, 0.601-0.81, p-value=0.035).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIntegrated automated video TN analysis with deep learning-based segmentation and classification accurately delineates TNs in an\\nautomated fashion and substantially outperforms static image-based classification for malignancy.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nUltrasound cine loops provide additional spatial information useful for classifying thyroid nodules. Deep learning has the potential to\\nautomate video segmentation for improved diagnostic accuracy.\\n\\nSSNR16-06 TI-RADS Modification Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques May Improve Radiologists Decision\\n\\nMaking\\n\\nParticipants\\nAylin Tahmasebi, Philadelphia, PA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nShuo Wang, Philadelphia, PA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nKelly Daniels, Philadelphia, PA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nElizabeth Cottrill, MD, Philadelphia, PA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJi-Bin Liu, MD, Philadelphia, PA (Abstract Co-Author) Research Grant, General Electric Company\\nJiajun Xu, MD, Philadelphia, PA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nAndrej Lyshchik, MD, PhD, Philadelphia, PA (Abstract Co-Author) Royalties, Reed ElsevierSpeaker, General Electric\\nCompanyConsultant, General Electric CompanyResearch support, General Electric Company Speaker, SonoScape Co, LtdConsultant,\\nBioClinica, IncAdvisory Board, Bracco GroupResearch support, Bracco Group Research support, Canon Medical Systems\\nCorporationResearch support, Siemens AG\\nJohn R.

A Google AutoML program was employed for both automated ITN\\nidentification and subsequent classification. 211 ITNs were used for model training and 47 reserved for model/radiologist testing.\\nThree blinded radiologists scored the images of the 47 ITNs using TI-RADS scoring. Lesions were subsequently assigned a risk level\\nwhere TR1-3 were considered low risk, TR4 was at the readers discretion, and TR5 was considered high risk. When using the AI-\\nmodified TI-RADS approach, ITNs with a radiologist-assigned TR1-3 were considered low risk, TR5 considered high risk, but\\nradiologist-assigned TR4 nodules were classified using the AI model. Diagnostic performance was evaluated against pathology or\\nNGS results with presence of a high risk mutation conferring high risk.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe AI algorithm correctly located all 47 ITNs in the testing set (100% object detection). When predicting high risk, the AI model\\nachieved sensitivity of 68.31% and positive predictive value (PPV) of 86.81% during the training and sensitivity of 73.9%,\\nspecificity of 70.8%, PPV of 70.8%, negative predictive value (NPV) of 73.9% and overall accuracy of 66.7% during the testing.\\nInitial radiologist performance resulted in a sensitivity of 52.1±4.4%, specificity of 65.2±6.4%, PPV of 59.1±3.5%, NPV of\\n58.7±1.8%, and accuracy of 58.8±2.5%. AI-modified TI-RADS demonstrated improvements in all criteria with a sensitivity of\\n53.6±17.6% (p=0.87), specificity of 83.3±7.2% (p=0.06), PPV of 75.7±8.5% (p=0.13), NPV of 66.0±8.8% (p=0.31), and accuracy\\nof 68.7±7.4% (p=0.21).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nAI-modified TI-RADS improved the performance of both radiologists and AI alone when classifying ITNs referred for biopsy. This\\napproach may help more accurately identifying truly high risk nodules needing further evaluation and treatment.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nIncorporation of AI into TI-RADS improved all diagnostic criteria relative to the traditional TI-RADS, this may help in more accurate\\nidentification of truly high risk nodules for further evaluation.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSPD05\\n\\nScience Session with Keynote: Pediatrics (Fetal Imaging)\\n\\nTuesday, Dec. 1 5:00PM - 6:00PM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nMR OB\\n\\nPD US\\n\\nSQ\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .75\\n\\nFDA  Discussions may include off-label uses.\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSPD05-01 Pediatrics Keynote Speaker:\\n\\nParticipants\\nMariana L.

Assessment of fetal lung stiffness by SWE has not been performed in fetal models of left-sided CDH. The purpose of this\\nstudy was to evaluate right lung elastography values in fetal lambs with and without diaphragmatic hernia.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nFollowing IACUC-approved protocols, 3 fetal lambs underwent surgical left-sided CDH creation at 70-78 days gestational age (GA).\\nAt 135-141 days GA (term=145 days), animals with CDH and 4 control animals were evaluated in simulated fetal surgery. A Siemens\\nSequoia ultrasound system with a linear 10L4 transducer optimized for shear wave elastography (SWE) was used to evaluate the\\nperipheral right lower lobe stiffness of each animal at an imaging depth of 1-3 cm (Figure 1). Mean lung stiffness (kPa) was\\ncompared between the groups using a one-way ANOVA. Post-mortem evaluation confirmed the presence of CDH. Total lung weight\\n(TLW), total lung volumes (TLV), and lung weight/body weight (LW/BW) were also compared between groups with Welch\\'s t tests.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nA total of 122 SWE measurements of the peripheral right lung were analyzed, of which 47 were in fetuses with CDH and 75 were in\\ncontrols. There was a statistically significant increase in mean lung stiffness in CDH animals compared to controls (4.03 ± 1.19 kPa\\nvs. 3.13 ± 0.56 kPa, p<0.001). Additionally CDH animals demonstrated decreased mean TLW, TLV, and LW/BW when compared to\\ncontrols (72.8g vs. 139.7g; p=0.01, 155.9mL vs. 219.7mL; p=0.17, and 1.7% vs. 2.5%; p=0.04, respectively).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nUsing SWE, increased right lung stiffness values are identified in fetal lambs with CDH which correspond with decreased lung weight\\nand volume.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nSWE can potentially be utilized as a noninvasive technique to evaluate CDH severity and potentially serve as an imaging correlate\\nfor underlying pathologic findings.\\n\\nSSPD05-03 Atlas-based Tractography Demonstrates Developmental Trajectories and Emerging Asymmetries in\\n\\nthe Fetal Cerebral White Matter\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Resident\\n\\nParticipants\\nFedel Machado, MD, Boston, MA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nClemente Velasco-Annis, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nOnur Afacan, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nSimon K.

For each GA-week, a compound data set was\\ncreated using between 5 and 13 fetuses. Deterministic ROI-based tractography was performed, with supervision from a pediatric\\nneuroradiologist. We delineated: forceps major (purple*), forceps minor (yellow*), superior (SCP) and middle (MCP) cerebellar\\npeduncles, corticospinal tracts (CST) (blue*), fornix, uncinate fasciculi (UF), inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi (IFOF) (green*) and\\ninferior longitudinal fasciculi (ILF) (*depicted in Figure). Tract volume and FA were measured. Differences in laterality were\\ncompared using a Wilcoxon signed rank-test. A linear regression analysis evaluated GA and anatomic tracts as predictors of volume\\nand FA.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe SCP and cingulum were not identified in the 24 and 25 GA-week atlas. Otherwise, all tracts were identified in the atlas for 24\\nand 25 GA and all other weeks. With increasing GA, the tracts became less compact and more arborized. The volume of the left ILF\\n(median 3.746 IQR 2.2ml) and left cingulum 0.411 IQR 0.375ml) were significantly higher (P < 0.02, both) than that of the\\ncontralateral tracts (median 3.58 IQR 1.423ml and median 0.254 IQR 0.276ml, respectively). The FA of the right IFOF (median\\n0.1229 IQR 0.0119) was significantly higher (P = 0.036) than that of the left (median 0.1195 IQR 0.0116). Age and tract were\\nsignificant predictors of volume (all P < 0.001) except for forceps minor and ILF. Similarly, age and tract were significant predictors\\nof FA (all P < 0.001) except for forceps minor.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nFetal DTI atlas-based tractography show complex tract-specific development trajectories and emerging asymmetries in white\\nmatter tracts.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nDiffusion-atlas tractography provides a robust method to study normal development and could enhance our ability to detect\\nabnormalities in utero.\\n\\nSSPD05-04 Evaluation of Sulcal Developmental Asymmetry in Fetal Cerebral Isolated Ventricolomegalia by Fetal\\n\\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging and Post-Delivery Outcomes\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Resident\\n\\nParticipants\\nSepideh Sefidbakht, MD, Powel, OH (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nPooya Iranpour, MD, Shiraz, Iran (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nSaeed Esmailian, MD, Shiraz, Iran (islamic Rep.

To compare degree of asymmetry with\\npost-delivery outcome\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nOur Institutional Ethics Committee approved this retrospective study. All participants provided informed consent. Out of 658 Fetal\\nMRI\\'s performed in our tertiary referral center, 67 fetuses with isolated ventriculomegaly (ventricular width >=10mm no other\\nstructural anomaly seen in ultrasound or MRI) and 77 fetuses with normal brains based on prenatal ultrasound and MRI were\\nincluded in the study. Fetal MRI images were retrospectively and blindly reviewed by two radiologists. Sulcal development was\\nscored based on Kriakopoulou and using Van der Knapp scoring method for each side separately. Asymmetry score is defined as sum\\nof right side cortical development scores minus left side CDS divided by number of visible sulci Post-delivery developmental\\noutcomes were assessed using ASQ Questionnaires obtained at least one year post-delivery.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe mean gestational ages were 28.6±6.3 weeks and 28.4±6.1 respectively in the fetuses with and without ventriculomegaly (p=\\n0.9 ).The mean sulcal development score was 3.6±1.1 And 4.5±1.3 respectively for fetuses with and without ventriculomegaly (p=\\n0.03 ). The mean asymmetry scores were 1.4±1.0 and 0.2±1.0 for fetuses with and without Ventriculomegaly(0.001). The mean\\nventricular size was 14.4 ±11.2 mm in fetuses with ventriculomegaly. The ASQ score was 11.3 ± 9.8 month and 22.6 ± 12.8 month\\nin fetuses with and without VMG. At year 2 of age, only 39% of the children with prenatal isolated ventriculomegaly seen in fetal\\nMRI had a normal neurodevelopment. Also 8% of fetuses with ventriculomegaly underwent neonatal death\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe fetuses with VMG had significant delay in sulcation and development comparing to the control fetuses. Sulcal asymmetry was\\nmore common in fetuses with ventriculomegaly who had delayed development, comparing to those with ventriculomegaly but normal\\ndevelopmental outcome.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nBecause of the heterogeneous and uncertain prognosis of mild Ventriculomegaly, counseling the parents is a dilemma. Sulcal\\nasymmetry might help determine prognosis in fetuses with ventriculomegaly.\\n\\n\\x0cSSPD05-05 Automated Fetal Brain Volumetry on Clinical Fetal MRI Using Convolutional Neural Network\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Medical Student\\n\\nParticipants\\nCarol B.

Global and regional volume assessments are critical for characterizing fetal brain development. We sought to develop a\\ndeep learning-based method for automated fetal brain segmentation and volume quantification from single-shot fast spin echo T2-\\nweighted fetal MRIs.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nWe adapted a U-Net convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for analysis of fetal brain MRIs. After re-sampling 2D fetal\\nbrain acquisitions to 1x1x1mm 3D volumes using linear interpolation, the network was trained to automatically segment the brain\\nusing data from 39 randomly sampled, normal fetal brain MRI scans of singleton pregnancies. Training was performed in 3 acquisition\\nplanes (axial, coronal, sagittal) where available, treating each acquisition as an independent training sample, for 113 total training\\nvolumes. During testing, the U-Net output was processed by taking the largest contiguous cluster of voxels and discarding\\nremaining predicted voxels. Performance was evaluated on 10 test MRIs (in 3 acquisition planes, for 30 total test samples) using\\nDice scores and volume assessments compared to manual segmentations.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe CNN resulted in highly accurate segmentations of fetal brains (20-36 gestational weeks). On independent test samples, overlap\\nbetween segmentations predicted by U-Net and by human reference standard was near-perfect (median Dice 0.95 in each\\nacquisition plane, interquartile range across all test samples 0.94-0.96). The method generated total brain volumes highly correlated\\nwith manual measurements (r=0.997) and with low error (root median squared percentage error 2.4%). Gestational age and brain\\nvolume were significantly correlated (Spearman rho=0.94, p<0.001).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nA 3D U-Net produced highly accurate automated segmentations of fetal brains on MRIs acquired in 3 planes. The method has\\npotential to provide accurate volumetric data that can be incorporated into assessments of fetal neurologic development. We plan\\nto retrospectively generate a normative database of >1500 fetal brain volumes across gestational ages collected at our institution.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nAutomated deep learning methods can achieve accurate segmentations of fetal brain MR imaging and provide accurate quantitative\\nestimates of fetal brain volume across a wide range of gestational ages.\\n\\nSSPD05-06 The Evaluation of Placental Vascularization by MV-Flow and Power Doppler in Normal and Growth\\n\\nRestricted Fetuses\\n\\nParticipants\\nWei Xia, Wuhan, China (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nJianbo Shao, Wuhan, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nXinlin Chen, Wuhan, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\n176778380@qq.com\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo evaluate the placental vascularization by MV-Flow which is a novel visualization technology and power Doppler for low-velocity\\nvessels in normal and intrauterine growth restricted fetuses.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nPlacental vascularization sonography by MV-Flow and power Doppler were performed on 126 normal fetuses and 22 fetuses with\\nintrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) between 11 and 41 weeks.

We apply a novel model-based material decomposition (MBMD) method that integrates the layer-specific\\nspatial- and spectral-resolution properties.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nA prototype dual-layer flat-panel detector is investigated with a 200 μm CsI scintillator top layer that collects relatively low-energy\\nmeasurements and a 550 μm CsI scintillator bottom layer for a relatively high-energy channel. Both channels use a-Si detector\\npanel consisting of 2880 x 2880 of 150 μm pixels. A 1 mm copper filtration layer is sandwiched between the two layers to improve\\nspectral separation. Due to the different scintillator thicknesses, two layers exhibit different spatial blur. An MBMD method is\\nproposed for direct estimation of material density distribution from the measurements with specific channel-dependent blur kernels\\nincluded in the forward model. Presuming the measurements follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution, a penalized-weighted least-\\nsquares objective function is derived and optimized iteratively using Newton\\'s method. Two custom phantoms were 3D-printed and\\nimmersed in 50 mg/mL iodine solution, presenting various line-pairs or trabecular structures in iodine. Each was scanned with 720\\nviews over 360 degrees with no pixel binning. Water and iodine density volumes (400 x 400 x 5, 110 μm cubic voxels) were\\nestimated using three different methods: image-domain decomposition (IDD) from FBP reconstructions, MBMD with an idealized\\nmodel (iMBMD), and MBMD with system blur modeling (bMBMD).\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nCompared with the IDD result, the MBMD results exhibit significant noise reduction with standard deviation decreased by 30% and\\nimprove spatial resolution. Modulation at 3.5 lp/mm in iMBMD result increases by 34%, which is further improved in bMBMD result by\\n200%.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nA prototype dual-layer flat-panel CBCT system was investigated with custom high-frequency phantoms. The proposed MBMD\\nextends the high-resolution capability of this technology with system blur modeling, taking advantage of the high-resolution low-\\nenergy channel.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nDual-layer flat-panel CBCT systems enable high-resolution spectral imaging in vascular and orthopedic applications. The proposed\\nMBMD method with system blur modeling can improve spatial resolution.\\n\\nSSPH02-02 Simultaneous Dual-contrast Biphasic Liver Imaging with Iodine and Gadolinium Using Photon-\\n\\ncounting-detector CT: A Feasibility Animal Study\\n\\nAwards\\n\\n\\x0cTrainee Research Prize - Fellow\\n\\nParticipants\\nLiqiang Ren, PhD, Rochester, MN (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nNathan Huber, Rochester, MN (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nKishore Rajendran, PhD, Rochester, MN (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJoel G.

The quantification accuracy of iodine and gadolinium from a single scan was first evaluated in a phantom study, which also\\nserved as the calibration reference for material decomposition of in vivo swine PCD-CT data. A test bolus scan was performed in\\nthe swine to determine the time-attenuation curves for both late arterial and portal-venous phases, based on which the injection\\ntiming for the two contrast agents was calculated. A gadolinium contrast (Magnevist, 64 mL, 8 mL/s) bolus was intravenously\\ninjected, followed by a iodine contrast bolus (Omnipaque 350, 40mL, 5 mL/s), with a 17-second time interval. PCD-CT scan was\\nperformed 12 seconds after the initiation of the iodine contrast injection to simultaneously capture the late arterial phase (iodine)\\nand the portal-venous phase (gadolinium). All PCD-CT scans were acquired with 80 kV and energy thresholds of 25, 35, 50, and 55\\nkeV to provide optimal material separation and quantification. To suppress noise magnification during material decomposition, a\\nconvolutional-neural-network (CNN)-based de-noising method was applied.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nHepatic arteries containing iodine and veins containing gadolinium could be delineated from each other with misclassification\\nbetween two contrast materials less than 0.9 mg/mL. Compared to the original images, better distinctions between two liver phases\\nwere achieved for the CNN de-noised PCD-CT data with about 60% noise reduction in the contrast-specific images after material\\ndecomposition.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe feasibility of performing biphasic liver CT imaging in a single multi-energy CT scan using a dual-contrast (iodine and gadolinium)\\ninjection protocol was demonstrated in a swine study.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nSimultaneous biphasic liver imaging using PCD-CT may allow for improved diagnosis with perfect alignment of the anatomical\\nstructure in the two phases.\\n\\nSSPH02-04 Detectability and Separability of Iodine and Gadolinium Based Contrast Media in Photon-Counting CT\\n\\nParticipants\\nJayasai R.

Thresholds were selected based\\non simulations. An additional set of scans were completed with an energy integrated (EID) CT system for detectability comparison.\\nRegions of interest (ROIs) were drawn within vials and contrast values measured. Detection limits were determined using the\\ncontrast-to-noise ratios of contrast, using reference values of 5 and 2.5 as cutoffs, derived from the Rose criterion. Separability\\nwas measured by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) of multivariate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves\\nbetween vials of iodine and gadolinium with equivalent concentrations.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nFor both iodine and gadolinium, macro mode showed the highest contrast-to-noise ratio, with a 21.9% and 89.5% advantage over\\n\\n\\x0cEID and 10.9% and 22.5% advantage over chess for iodine and gadolinium respectively. In terms of separability, macro mode\\nshowed higher separability than chess with a reference AUC of 0.93 compared to 0.77, respectively, for 2 mg/mL concentration\\nlevels.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nFor the scan conditions studied, a two bin photon-counting mode showed better contrast-to-noise ratio, lower detection limits, and\\nsuperior separability between iodine and gadolinium signals when compared to a four bin photon-counting mode.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThe ability of spectral CT systems to detect and separate signal from different contrast media enables further clinical opportunities\\nincluding multi-contrast imaging.\\n\\nSSPH02-05 A Cascaded Deep-learning Reconstruction Method for Rapid kV-switching dual-energy CT with\\n\\nSparse-kV Sampling\\n\\nParticipants\\nRuoqiao Zhang, PhD, Vernon Hills, IL (Presenter) Employee, Canon Medical Systems Corporation\\nLiang Cai, Vernon Hills, IL (Abstract Co-Author) Employee, Canon Medical Systems Corporation\\nQiulin Tang, PhD, Vernon Hills, IL (Abstract Co-Author) Employee, Canon Medical Systems Corporation\\nAkshay Prabhu Verleker, MS,PhD, Otawara, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Employee, Canon Medical Systems Corporation \\nYuto Hamada, RT, Tochigi, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Employee, Canon Medical Systems Corporation\\nHiroki Taguchi, Otawara, Japan (Abstract Co-Author) Employee, Canon Medical Systems Corporation\\nJian Zhou, PhD, Vernon Hills, IL (Abstract Co-Author) Scientist, Canon Medical Systems Corporation \\nZhou Yu, Vernon Hills, IL (Abstract Co-Author) Employee, Canon Medical Systems Corporation\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nrzhang@mru.medical.canon\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTraditional fast kV-switching dual-energy CT (DECT) relies on hardware approaches to collect sufficient views at each kV, which\\nrequires frequent kV switching that prohibits effective tube current modulation. To reduce dependence on frequent kV switching,\\nwe proposed a cascaded deep-learning reconstruction method for rapid kV-switching DECT, which allows for sparse kV switching\\nwhile preserving resolution and effectively performing data-domain material decomposition.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThe proposed deep-learning reconstruction (DLR) method contains two deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), as one for\\nsinograms and the other for images. The sinogram DCNN estimates missing views using information from adjacent same-kV views\\nand opposite-kV view at the same location. To reduce noise and improve resolution, the image DCNN processes the FBP images as\\nreconstructed from two decomposed basis sinograms. Both DCNNs were trained using dual-rotation DECT data. In addition, training\\ntargets for image DCNN were reconstructed using single-energy DLR method for reduced noise and enhanced resolution. For\\nvalidation, we acquired kV-switching DECT data from an Aquilion ONE PRISM system (Canon Medical System Corporation, Otawara,\\nJapan), where we achieved sparse kV sampling by switching the kV in every few views. We compare the proposed method with\\nstandard AIDR3D result of dual-rotation DECT data acquired at a similar dose level using Catphan modules.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe proposed method with sparse kV switching (CTDIvol=7 mGy) achieves comparable or improved image quality as that of dual-\\nrotation DECT (CTDIvol=7.7 mGy) with standard AIDR3D method. Proposed method achieves about 35% noise reduction,\\ncomparable contrast-to-noise ratio on low contrast targets, and improved high contrast resolution as compared to traditional dual-\\nrotation DECT method at a similar dose level.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe proposed cascaded deep-learning reconstruction for sparse-kV rapid kV-switching DECT achieves reduced noise and improved\\nresolution as compared to dual-rotation DECT with standard AIDR3D reconstruction at a similar dose level.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThe proposed method is suitable for rapid kV-switching DECT with sparse kV sampling, which allows for efficient Automatic Exposure\\nControl (AEC) and potentially improves dose efficiency.\\n\\nSSPH02-06 A Comparison of Three Pileup Compensation Methods for Photon Counting Detectors\\n\\nParticipants\\nScott Hsieh, Rochester, MN (Presenter) Research support, Siemens AG\\nKris Iniewski, PhD, Saanichton, BC (Abstract Co-Author) Employee, Redlen Technologies\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nPhoton counting detectors (PCD) for CT have several advantages but suffer from pileup effects at high flux. Pileup compensation\\nelectronics have been proposed, but their effectiveness at improving noise in spectral tasks has not been studied. In this work, we\\nuse simulations to compare three approaches: (1) a \\'pileup trigger,\\' using an extra energy bin at high energy which counts only\\nduring pileup; (2) a standard retrigger architecture, which continues to count at regular intervals when a comparator would\\notherwise be paralyzed; (3) a novel modified retrigger architecture that routes retriggered counts into secondary counters so that\\ntheir information is not kept separate from regular counts.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nPhotons were incident on a single PCD pixel and the signal as a function of time was calculated assuming Poisson statistics, a\\nGaussian response function, a 120 kVp spectrum and 15 cm of water object filtration. Bin counts were calculated as comparator\\nthreshold crossings. PCDs used five bins equally spaced between 20 and 100 keV, and the pileup trigger was a sixth bin at 130 keV.\\nVariance in the iodine and water basis material images was estimated using the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). All systems were\\n\\n\\x0ccompared to a PCD without pileup compensation.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nAt low flux, pileup compensation electronics had little effect. At the characteristic count rate (moderate flux), standard deviation of\\nthe iodine basis material was decreased by about 45% using either the standard or modified retrigger architecture, and the pileup\\ntrigger had no effect. At three times the characteristic count rate (high flux), the standard deviations were reduced by about 40%\\nusing either the pileup trigger or standard retrigger architecture, and 70% using the modified retrigger architecture.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nPileup compensation electronics are able to extend the useful flux range for PCDs. Some forms of compensation are more effective\\nthan others. The standard retrigger architecture may be improved through our proposed use of dedicated secondary counters.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nPhoton counting CT has several potential advantages but is hampered by pileup. Our study shows that several pileup compensation\\nmethods are available that can mitigate this non-ideality.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSPH04\\n\\nPhysics (Image Analysis on COVID-19) (In Joint Sponsorship with the American Association of Physicists in\\nMedicine)\\n\\nW ednesday, Dec. 2 2:00PM - 3:00PM Room: Channel 5\\n\\nCT\\n\\nPH RS\\n\\nBQ AI\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .75\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSPH04-01 Performance Validation of Deep Learning-based Models for the Quantification of COVID-19\\n\\nPneumonia and Its Application to Development of Machine Learning Model for Differentiating COVID-\\n19 Cases from ILD and Normal Cases Using Chest CT\\n\\nParticipants\\nBeomhee Park, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nKyu-Hwan Jung, Phd, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Shareholder, VUNO IncEmployee, VUNO Inc\\nJin-Kyeong Sung, MD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Employee, VUNO Inc\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo evaluate the performance of two machine learning models; (i) convolutional neural network(CNN) model for the quantification of\\nlesions related to COVID-19 pneumonia, (ii) random forest model for differentiating COVID-19 cases from interstitial lung\\ndisease(ILD) and normal cases based on the quantification result\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThe CNN-based quantification model was originally developed in the earlier study to quantify ILD-related patterns and modified to\\npredict only COVID-19 pneumonia related patterns such as ground-glass opacity(GGO), reticular patterns, and consolidation. A\\nrandom forest model was trained to classify COVID-19 cases from non-COVID-19 cases based on the features calculated from the\\nquantification result. The features used were representative CT findings of COVID-19 pneumonia; relative volume of each patterns\\nto whole lung volume, relative volume of each pattern to all lesion volume, number of affected lobes, and binary indicator of lesion\\ndistribution(bilateral, posterior, peripheral, basal). The training set consists of 57 COVID-19 confirmed cases as positive samples and\\ncombination of 96 ILD and 496 NLST cases as negative samples. The performance of quantification and classification was evaluated\\nwith separate samples consisting of 20 COVID-19, 95 ILD, 496 NLST cases.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe Dice similarity coefficient for lesion quantification in COVID-19 confirmed cases was 0.685, which is compatible to the\\nperformance of a previously reported model explicitly trained to segment COVID-19 lesions. The performance of model for\\ndifferentiating COVID-19 cases from NLST cases was 0.989, 1.00 and 0.956 in AUC, sensitivity and specificity, while performance of\\ndifferentiating COVID-19 from ILD was lower with 0.906, 1.00 and 0.674, respectively. The most significant features for\\ndifferentiating COVID-19 from ILD was the relative volume of GGO and basal distribution of lesions.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe CNN-based model developed for quantifying ILD patterns showed moderate performance for quantifying COVID-19 pneumonia\\nlesions. While the sensitivity of detecting COVID-19 cases is high, differentiating COVID-19 pneumonia from ILD was relatively\\ndifficult due to the similarity of CT findings in two diseases.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nAn automatic system for quantification and differentiation of lung disease has potential to be used as screening tool to triage\\npatients with respiratory infection such as COVID-19.\\n\\nSSPH04-02 Justification of Radiological Procedures in COVID-19 Pandemic Based on Radiation Risk Only\\n\\nParticipants\\nFrancesco Ria, DMP, Durham, NC (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nWanyi Fu, BEng, Durham, NC (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nHamid Chalian, MD, Durham, NC (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nEhsan Abadi, Durham, NC (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nWilliam P.

In X-ray imaging, while the benefit is often immediate\\nfor the patient, the associated radiation risk is a longer-term effect. Such a temporal gap can bias the justification process in\\n\\n\\x0cimaging utilization, particularly during a spreading pandemic like COVID-19 in which fast and accurate diagnostic tools are highly\\nneeded. Chest CT and chest radiography (CXR) have shown promising results in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19,\\nproviding support to the standard RT-PCR test. However, several institutions are discouraging the use of imaging for this purpose,\\npartly due to radiation risk. This study aims to provide quantitative data towards an effective risk-to benefit analysis for the\\njustification of radiological studies in COVID-19 diagnosis and management to guide clinicians and decision making.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThe analysis was performed in terms of mortality rate per age group. COVID-19 mortality was extracted from epidemiological data\\nacross 159,107 patients in Italy. For radiological risk, the study considered 659 Chest CT scans performed in adult patients. Organ\\ndoses were estimated using a Monte Carlo based method and then used to calculate a risk index that was converted into a related\\n5-year mortality rate (SEER, NCI).\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nCOVID-19 mortality showed a rapid rise for ages >30 years old (min: 0.30%; max: 30.20%). Only 1 death was reported in the\\nanalyzed patient cohort for ages <20 years old. The mortality rates based on radiation exposure decreased across age groups. The\\nmedian mortality rate across all ages for Chest CT and CXR were 0.72% (min: 0.46%; max: 1.10%) and 0.03% (min: 0.02%; max:\\n0.04%), respectively.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nRadiation risk is not the only factor that should be taken into account for justifying the use of imaging in COVID care; nonetheless,\\nit is an essential factor of consideration. The risk associated with COVID-19, CT, and CXR exhibited different magnitudes and trends\\nacross age groups. In higher ages, COVID-19 risk far outweighed that of radiological exams. Based on risk comparison alone, CXR\\nand Chest CT are justified for COVID-19 care of patients older than 30 and 50 years old, respectively.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nTowards a comprehensive radiological procedures risk-to-benefit assessment, CT and CXR should not be a priori excluded in the\\ndiagnosis and management of the COVID-19.\\n\\nSSPH04-03 Virtual Imaging Trials for Novel Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)\\n\\nParticipants\\nEhsan Abadi, Durham, NC (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nWilliam P.

This study aimed to impalement and demonstrate a virtual\\nimaging trial platform for COVID-19, enabling effective assessment and optimization of CT and X-ray radiography acquisitions for\\nreliable imaging and management of COVID-19.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nAn existing VIT platform was adapted to incorporate COVID-19 features. Using an IRB-approved protocol, confirmed COVID-19\\npatient cases were manually segmented for all pulmonary features related to the disease. The segmentations were verified by a\\ncardiothoracic radiologist. The segmented features (e.g., ground glass opacity, consolidation, crazy paving) were made into 4D\\nextended cardiac-torso (XCAT) phantoms. Within a given disease area, the texture and material of the lung parenchyma in the\\nXCAT were modified to match the physical properties observed in the clinical images. To demonstrate the utility, the COVID-19\\nphantoms were virtually imaged using a scanner-specific CT and radiography simulator (DukeSim). CT and Radiography simulation\\nincluded varied models of COVID-19 as a function of applied radiation dose.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nWe developed the first computational models of COVID-19 patients and demonstrated how their combination with imaging simulators\\nfor imaging studies. Qualitatively, the simulated abnormalities had realistic shapes and texture. This platform gives us the ability to\\nimage the same patients with both modalities under various parameters. For example, results showed that in the abnormal regions\\nthe contrast to noise ratio, a metric relevant to abnormality detection, were 1.6, 3.0, and 3.6 for 5, 25, and 50 mAs images,\\nrespectively.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe developed toolsets in this study provides the foundation for use of virtual imaging trials in effective assessment and\\noptimization of CT and X-ray radiography acquisitions and analysis tools to manage COVID-19 pandemic.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nWe establish a platform in which the potential utility of CT and X-ray imaging for COVID-19 management can be assessed using\\nmodels of patients and scanner with a priori knowledge of ground truth.\\n\\nSSPH04-04 Wireless Handheld Ultrasound for COVID-19 Infected Patients in Isolation Ward on Diagnosis and\\n\\nClinical Care\\n\\nParticipants\\nZhili Xu, PhD, Guangzhou, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nHongmei Liu, Guangzhou, China (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nBo Gao, Guangzhou, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nLi Ma, Guangzhou, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\n\\x0cFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nhongmeiliu3@163.com\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nWireless handheld ultrasound results in more convenient, faster, safer and cheaper diagnosis than CT and DR, also easier to\\ndisinfect. The application of wireless handheld ultrasound contributes to increase the cure rate of COIVD-19 infection and delay the\\nprogress of this epidemic.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nCoronavirus disease-2019(COVID-19) is an emerging, rapidly evolving situation, which caused a large global outbreak. There have\\nbeen more than 2 million reported cases of COVID-19 and 146,489 reported deaths to date (17/04/2020). CT or DR scanning is\\nexpensive and inconvenient for isolated patients. However, wireless handheld ultrasound has become the most promising imaging\\nmethod for isolated patients in clinic therapy.\\n\\nEvaluation\\n\\n20 COVID-19 infected patients in isolation ward have been checked using wireless ultrasound. 2 patients were diagnosed as\\ncholecystolithiasis, 1 patient as cholestasis with cholecystitis, 1 patient as enormous renal calculus with hydronephrosis, 2 patients\\nas gouty arthritis. Besides, 2 patients were also tried to detect pneumonia and evaluate disease progression or efficacy with the\\nwireless handheld ultrasound.\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nMany patients have developed complication after the wide use of antibacterials in therapy of COVID-19 infection. Wireless handheld\\nultrasound can quickly diagnose complication, which will help doctors to develop suitable therapeutic regimen and decrease\\nmisdiagnosis rate. Besides, the small superficial area of wireless handheld ultrasound makes it easier for sterilization than CT or DR\\nmachine. More importantly, the limited contact area between ultrasound machine and patients will reduce the contact transmission\\nCOIVD-19.\\n\\nSSPH04-05 Evaluation of Image Quality and Radiation Safety for the Non-Standard Use of Portable X-ray in\\n\\nResponse to COVID-19 Pandemics\\n\\nParticipants\\nSarah E.

The patient dose roughly stays unchanged due to glass attenuation of low energy x-rays. Radiation\\nexposure due to x-ray scatter is generally well under regulatory limits in these non-standard imaging conditions.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nIn response to a patient surge during the COVID-19 pandemic, portable x-ray equipment is used for imaging through the glass of ED\\nisolation rooms or in outdoor triage tent areas. To maintain diagnostic image quality and radiation safety for patients and hospital\\nstaff in these conditions, we performed phantom evaluations for quantitative evaluation of image quality and exposure.\\n\\nEvaluation\\n\\nAn anthropomorphic chest phantom was used for chest x-ray through a sliding glass door (Fig 1a). The entrance air kerma and\\nbeam half-value layer was measured and the Exposure Index (EI) was recorded. Acquisitions were performed with the glass door\\nopen (standard) and closed (through-glass) using routine techniques. The mAs was increased for the through-glass scan to match\\nthe EI of the standard scan for the anthropomorphic and an image quality phantom (IQP) to obtain contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR).\\nPatient effective dose estimates were calculated via Monte Carlo (PCMXC20). A radiation scatter survey was performed to evaluate\\nstaff safety (Fig 1b).To facilitate patient triage and reduce potential exposure, tents were set up in a dedicated area of an outdoor\\nparking lotand portable x-ray units were used to scan patients in one tent (Fig 1c). A radiation scatter survey was performed in\\nsurrounding locations of the tent (Fig 1d). Safe distance and caution signs were set up based on survey results\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nThe glass door attenuated 50% attenuation of x-ray flux. The EI for the chest phantom and CNR of the IQP was matched by\\nincreasing tube current by 50% through glass and this reduced the patient effective dose was 20%. However, in the later trial of\\npatient scanning, tube current was increased by 100% due to the difference in phantom and patient attenuation profile.\\n\\nSSPH04-06 A Sensitive Merit to Differentiate COVID-19 Cases from Others in CT Images\\n\\nParticipants\\nYongfeng Gao, Stony Brook, NY (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nJerome Z.

Gould, MD, Oyster Bay, NY (Abstract Co-Author) Consultant, Endo International plc\\n\\n\\x0cFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nJerome.Liang@stonybrookmedicine.edu\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nComputed tomography (CT) of COVID-19 shows a relatively global effect through the whole lungs, mimicking many other lung\\nabnormalities. This characteristic effect renders the difficulties in differentiating COVID-19 from other lung diseases. This work\\npresents a novel method to relieve the difficulties.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThe method aims to reduce the global effect through the 3D whole lung volume into 2D domain, where the anatomic land-markers\\nalong the z-axis, denoted as Lung Marks are used to eliminate axial variable so that the cross section at each z location has similar\\ntexture patterns for normal subjects. Our experiments indicated that 30 Lung Marks are sufficient to eliminate the axial variable.\\nThe method computes texture measures from each 2D cross section and maps the measures on to the corresponding Lung Mark,\\nresulting in a profile along the z-axis. The difference of the profiles between two different abnormalities is the proposed sensitive\\nmerit to differentiate COVID-19 cases from others in CT images.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nTo show the effectiveness of the proposed sensitive merit, 48 COVID-19 cases and 48 normal screening cases were used. Firstly,\\nthe lungs of each of the 96 cases were segmented, and the segmented whole lungs were labeled/registered to the 30 Lung Marks\\nalong the axial direction. Texture measures (traditional Haralick features) were computed from each axial cross image at the\\ncorresponding Lung Mark along the z-axis to generate the profiles of the proposed sensitive merit. A skew U shape distribution was\\nobserved in the vector distance of the texture measure between the normal and COVID-19 subjects.

Beam hardening artifacts are reduced and, most\\nimportantly, patient dose is significantly reduced since low energy photons are nearly completely absorbed in the patient and do\\nnot contribute to the image. However, to achieve similar image quality, the tube power needs to be increased with increasing\\nprefilter thickness. Today, CT systems with 0 and 0.4, with 0 and 0.6, and with 0, 0.4, and 0.7 mm tin (Sn) prefiltration are in use.\\nHere, the potential of using finer gradations and thicker prefilters is investigated. To do so, semiantropomorphic liver phantoms\\ncontaining iodine and soft tissue contrast inserts were simulated at different sizes: 15×10 (child), 30×20 (adult) and 50×40 cm\\n(obese). Simulations were performed with 0 to 2 mm Sn and with 30 to 150 kV tube voltage. Dose was assessed using Monte Carlo\\nsimulations of the 32 cm CTDI phantom. Contrast-to-noise ratios at unit dose (CNRD) were calculated for soft tissue contrast and\\niodine contrast.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nIncreasing Sn prefilter thickness yields a significant increase in soft tissue CNRD (30% dose reduction at 0.7 mm for the adult\\nphantom, mAs increase by a factor of 7.4). Optimal tube voltage increases with patient size and is to be individually selected for\\neach filter thickness. Depending on patient size iodine CNRD reaches a maximum at different Sn prefilter thickness (0.0, 0.2 and 0.8\\nmm). While no dose reduction could be achieved for the child phantom using a Sn Filter maximum dose reduction was 14% and 33%\\nfor the adult and obese phantoms. Here, mAs needed to be increased by a factor of 13 and 61 respectively. Deviating from the\\noptimal filter thickness by 0.1 mm results in a dose increase of up to 4%.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nFor optimal iodine CNRD the Sn prefilter thickness should be adapted to the patient size. Soft tissue CNRD can be maximized by\\nchoosing the prefilter as thick as tube power allows to. Fine gradation of filter thickness should be available in the filter changer\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nDose reduction in clinical CT is important for patient safety.\\n\\nSSPH05-02 Natural-image-based Neural Network Denoising Framework and Its Application to Photon-Counting\\n\\nDetector CT\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Resident\\n\\nParticipants\\nNathan Huber, Rochester, MN (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nAndrew Missert, PHD, Rochester, MN (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nHao Gong, PhD, Rochester,, MN (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nLifeng Yu, PhD, Rochester, MN (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nCynthia H.

For training, CNN denoising algorithms often use CT projection data and noise insertion\\nto synthesize CT images at different dose (noise) levels. However, limited access to projection data makes it difficult to implement\\nthis approach. Here we describe a training framework that uses a public natural image database and does not require projection\\ndata access.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThe denoising framework uses transfer learning; noise realizations from repeated phantom CT scans are superimposed onto natural\\nimages to mimic CT images at different dose levels. ImageNet was used for this task because of its diverse feature space, high\\nresolution, and low noise. Patches were extracted from ImageNet and scaled to match the Hounsfield unit range of CT images. Prior\\nto each training epoch, noise patches were shuffled and added to natural images. The CNN was trained to remove the\\nsuperimposed CT noise and restore the underlying natural image. A residual architecture was used containing 18 convolutional\\nlayers, each with 128 features, and a mean-squared-error loss function. The technique was tested on 150-micron resolution\\nthoracic CT images acquired from 5 patients on a research photon-counting-detector (PCD) CT scanner. Noise and edge sharpness\\nwere visually assessed, noise was measured in the aorta and sharpness quantified using line profiles.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe CNN reduced noise by 74.2 ± 0.2 % compared to images created using filtered back projection and a sharp reconstruction\\nkernel. Visual and line profile assessments demonstrated that fine anatomic details were preserved in the denoised images. In the\\nshoulder, the sharp boundary of cortical bone was well maintained and noise reduction in the trabecular bone regions improved\\ndelineation of fine structures. Similar improvements were observed in lung images.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe developed CNN denoising framework provides extensive noise reduction while maintaining fine anatomic features. Because this\\nmethod uses only phantom scans and publically available data, it can be easily implemented.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThe ability to implement CNN denoising methods with a widely accessible natural image database and easily acquired phantom scans\\nmakes CT denoising available to anyone working in the field.\\n\\nSSPH05-03 Deep Learning Image Reconstruction (DLIR) for Evaluating Large Airways in Chest CT in Children\\n\\nwith Ultra-low Dose\\n\\nParticipants\\nJi Hang Sun, Beijing, China (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nHaoyan Li, Beijing, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJianying Li, Beijing, China (Abstract Co-Author) Employee, General Electric Company\\nXuan Zhang, MD, Beijing, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nYun Peng, MD, Beijing, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo assess the ability of a Deep Learning Image Reconstruction (DLIR) algorithm in evaluating large airways with ultra-low radiation\\ndose chest CT in children.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\n17 children (age range 3-12y, average 6.5±3.0years) for follow-up examination underwent ultra-low-dose plain chest CT with 80kV\\n(3-6 years) or 100kV (7-12 years), 10mA, 0.35s rotation time and were enrolled in the study group. Images were reconstructed\\nwith the state-of-the-art Adaptive Statistical Iterative Reconstruction-V at 50% strength (50%ASIR-V) with standard kernel and\\nDLIR at low (DL-L), medium (DL-M) and high settings (DL-H) at slice thickness of 0.625mm. These same patients underwent CT\\nscans in routine radiation dose less than 3 months earlier were included in the control group, and the images were reconstructed\\nwith 50%ASIR-V. Two radiologists independently evaluated images for evaluating large airways in the lungs on a 5-point scales (5,\\nexcellent, 4, good, 3, measurable and acceptable, 2, identifiable and 1, not acceptable). The objective image quality of the lung\\nparenchyma was measured and statistically compared among the 5 reconstruction groups. Finally, radiation dose was recorded for\\nthe two patient groups based on the report of ICRP103 and compared.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe CTDIvol and effective dose was 0.07±0.03mGy and 0.04±0.01mSv, respectively for the ultra-low dose group, 98% lower than\\nthe 3.2±0.8mGy and 2.1±0.5mSv, respectively for the control group. The image noise (in HU) of lung parenchyma of the ultra-low\\ndose group was 50.6±10.1 with 50%ASIR-V, 57.5±11.5 with DL-L, 52.2±10.8 with DL-M, and 43.2±10.0 with DL-H images, all\\nsignificantly higher than the 27.5±8.2 in the control group.

Patient dose is significantly reduced since low energy\\nphotons are nearly completely absorbed in the patient and do not contribute to the image. However, to achieve similar image\\nquality, the tube power needs to be increased with increasing prefilter thickness. Today, CT systems with additional tin (Sn)\\nprefiltration are in use. Here, it is investigated if materials with a lower k-edge energy, such as copper (Cu), provide a dose\\nadvantage over Sn in diagnostic single energy CT. To do so, semiantropomorphic liver phantoms containing iodine and soft tissue\\ncontrast inserts were simulated at different sizes: 15×10 (child), 30×20 (adult) and 50×40 cm (obese). Scans were simulated with\\n0 to 2 mm prefilter thickness and 35 to 150 kV tube voltage. Dose was assessed using Monte Carlo simulations of the 32 cm CTDI\\nphantom. Contrast-to-noise ratios at unit dose (CNRD) were calculated for soft tissue and for iodine contrast. Optimal tube voltage\\nwas selected for each filter material and thickness combination.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nSoft tissue CNRD showed no significant difference between Sn and Cu prefilters. However, iodine CNRD for child and adult phantoms\\nbehaved significantly different. While iodine CNRD reached a maximum at low Sn thicknesses it rather increased monotonously with\\nincreasing Cu thickness. For the obese phantom both materials caused iodine CNRD to increase with increasing prefilter thickness.\\nUsing Sn no dose reduction could be achieved for the child phantom while maximum dose reduction was 14% and 33% for adult and\\nobese phantoms respectively. Here, mAs needed to be increased by a factor of 13 and 61. Considering Cu maximum dose reduction\\nwas about 45% for all phantom sizes. However, the mAs value increased by five orders of magnitude. A 40% dose reduction was\\npossible with a 50-fold mAs increase.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nCu prefiltration allows for significantly higher iodine CNRD than Sn prefiltration. Iodine CNRD can be maximized by choosing the Cu\\nprefilter as thick as tube power allows to.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nDose reduction in clinical CT is important for patient safety.\\n\\nSSPH05-05 Feasibility of Performing Chest CTA in Children with Both Low Radiation Dose and Contrast Medium\\n\\nDose by Using 70kVp and Deep Learning Image Reconstruction (DLIR)\\n\\nParticipants\\nJi Hang Sun, Beijing, China (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nJianying Li, Beijing, China (Abstract Co-Author) Employee, General Electric Company\\nXuan Zhang, MD, Beijing, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nYun Peng, MD, Beijing, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo assess the feasibility of performing chest CTA in children with low radiation dose and contrast medium dose using 70kVp and\\nDeep Learning Image Reconstruction (DLIR) algorithm.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\n33 children (age range 4 month-13 years, average 5.85±4.16 years) underwent low dose chest CTA with 70kVp and auto tube\\ncurrent modulation, the noise index was set at 11-15 based on children\\'s age, contrast medium (CM) dose was 0.8-1.2ml/kg.\\nImages were reconstructed with 50% and 100% Adaptive Statistical Iterative Reconstruction-V (ASIR-V) with standard kernel and\\nDLIR with a high setting (DL-H) at slice thickness of 0.625mm.

Images were captured with no grid, 6:1 grid (JPI Healthcare NY, 40 line pair/cm, 130cm focal\\ndistance), 12:1 grid (JPI Healthcare NY, 40 line pair/cm, 180cm focal distance). The kVp and mAs were set such that an Exposure\\nIndex (Carestream EI) of 1300 was achieved with the 12:1 grid (Small - 100 kVp, 2.2mAs; Medium - 110 kVp, 4mAs; Large - 120\\nkVp, 8 mAs) and were held constant for each patient size. No-grid acquisitions were processed with a U-Net deep learning\\nalgorithm (not FDA approved) trained using high-dose low-scatter images to predict scatter and increased noise resulting from grid\\nuse. The scatter and noise prediction was subtracted from the original image. Contrast and noise and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)\\nwere evaluated for features in the lung and mediastinum area.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nFeature contrast was improved with either physical and virtual grids. 12:1 grid provided the highest contrast improvement but also\\nhad the highest noise levels. The AI-based virtual grid improved contrast while maintaining lower noise levels. For the lung feature,\\nthe no-grid CNR was improved by 29-53% with the AI-based virtual grid compared to 5%-11% for 12:1 grid and 3-33% for 6:1 grid\\nacross patient size. For the mediastinum feature, CNR was improved by 4-8% with the AI-based virtual grid and 18-22% with 12:1\\ngrid and 7-18% with 6:1 grid across patient size.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nUnder fixed dose, an AI-based virtual grid with noise suppression improved contrast while maintaining low-image noise levels\\ncompared to physical anti-scatter grids - resulting in a greater CNR in the lung area. Although, a virtual grid still improved the CNR\\nfor features within very high scatter-to-primary ratio areas (i.e., Mediastinum) a physical grid provided the greatest performance in\\nthat environment.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nAI-based virtual grid suppression can provide a practical compromise to physical anti-scatter grids for radiographic imaging.\\nHowever, they have limitation under very high scatter conditions.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSPH06\\n\\nScience Session with Keynote: Physics (Image Reconstruction) (In Joint Sponsorship with the American\\nAssociation of Physicists in Medicine)\\n\\nSaturday, Dec. 5 8:30AM - 9:30AM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nCT MR NM PH AI\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .75\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSPH06-01 Physics Keynote Speaker: Learning-based Image Reconstruction\\n\\nParticipants\\nJeffrey A.

Also, an Ultra High Resolution CT (UHR-CT) system\\nwas developed. We report on the usefulness of the reconstruction method of metal artifact reduction in UHR-CT with self-made\\nphantom. For the phantom, a bundle of a plurality of brass cylinders was used. In addition, artifact reduction was evaluated by CT\\nvalue histogram between brass and surrounding material.Brass cylinders made it impossible to confirm the shape of the phantom due\\nto the occurrence of metal artifacts in both conventional CT and UHR-CT. Although artifacts was reduced by metal artifact\\nreduction reconstruction, the effect of reducing the metal artifact was more pronounced in UHR-CT than in conventional CT.We\\nmade a phantom modeling metallic bolt in orthopedic surgery, metallic denture in dental area and evaluated the artifact reduction\\neffect by UHR-CT and metal artifact reduction reconstruction. Compared to the conventional CT, it was confirmed that UHR-CT has\\nnot only high spatial resolution but also high artifact reduction effect.\\n\\nTABLE OF CONTENTS/OUTLINE\\n\\n1.

In this work, a new reconstruction framework was developed and\\nvalidated to enable single source helical CT to operate at pitches up to 4.0 without significant limited-view artifacts.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThe reconstruction framework combines a deep learning technique and the well-known Prior Image Constrained Compressed Sensing\\n(PICCS). The method consists of 1) a conventional FBP reconstruction with limited view artifacts, 2) a deep-learning network to\\nclean up image artifacts from the FBP reconstruction, and 3) a PICCS reconstruction using the deep learning output as prior image.\\nAbdomen and Chest CT exams from 1332 patients were retrospectively collected. First, CT sinogram data at helical pitches of 2, 3,\\nand 4 were simulated by forward projection of clinical CT image volumes using 16, 32, and 64 detector rows. Next, FBP\\nreconstructions were performed for all simulated sinograms (1332 scans x 3 pitches x 3 detector systems = 2,800,000 images) and\\n\\n\\x0cpaired with reference clinical CT images to train the deep learning network. Outputs of the deep learning network were then used\\nas prior images in PICCS to yield the DL-PICCS images. To assess the performance of DL-PICCS, 261 additional CT exams (229\\nsimulated + 32 experimental) were used. The objective image quality assessment metric SSIM was used to quantify DL-PICCS image\\nquality for 50,736 axial slices in the validation cohort compared to reference images.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nDL-PICCS images at pitch 2, 3, and 4 do not have visually noticeable image artifacts. Quantitative SSIM values for DL-PICCS\\nimages of the chest had mean of 0.998 ± 0.001 at pitch 2, 0.978 ± 0.008 at pitch 3, and 0.955 ± 0.013 at pitch 4. However, as\\npitch increases, some structural differences appear in the reconstructions compared to the reference as reflected in a slight drop in\\nSSIM values.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nDL-PICCS enables high quality single source helical CT image reconstruction up to pitch 4.0.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nPitch 4.0 reconstruction can immediately help reduce dose by a factor of more than 2 compared to current clinical pitches below\\n2.0, and enables 64-row/4.0 cm coverage CT systems to scan the entire heart within a single heartbeat and within a single breath\\nhold.\\n\\nSSPH06-05 Convenient Hyper Parameter Selection for Bayesian Image Reconstruction by Constructing A Theory-\\n\\ndriven Look-up Table\\n\\nParticipants\\nYongfeng Gao, Stony Brook, NY (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nJerome Z.

This work presents a\\nmethod of constructing a look-up guidance table to eliminate the cumbersome trial-error style.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nBy formulating the two basic terms of data fidelity and prior expectation in Bayesian theory as probability distribution functions, ß\\nbecomes the ratio of the data uncertainty (or variance a) and the prior tolerance (or σ). By considering the tissue-specific textures\\nin the to-be-reconstructed image as the figure of merit for medical diagnosis, two look-up tables were constructed to guide a\\nsteadily cooling down of the tissue texture patterns to ensure an acceptable image, mimicking the physical model of cooling down\\nthe temperature steadily for a high quality crystal. One look-up table is constructed as a-ß table, where σ is treated as the\\ntemperature of the texture patterns, and the other as a-γ table, where γ is defined as the ratio of fidelity and prior terms. During\\ntable construction, human observation as well as image quality measures were used.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nBoth simulated sinograms from numerical phantoms and high-quality patient CT images and real clinical sinograms from patients\\nwere used for the look-up table construction and testing. Consistence were observed across the three type sinogram data, and\\nalso for the constructed a-ß and a-γ tables. Both tables suggest smaller prior strength at starting point of iterative reconstruction\\nprocess and stronger prior at the end point. For testing the simulated phantom/clinical sinograms, comparable quantity images were\\nobtained with that using the empirical trial-error selection of hyper parameter. Testing on the real clinical sinograms, comparable\\nquantity images were obtained.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIn this work, we presented a way to avoid the empirical trial-error selection of the hyper parameter for Bayesian image\\nreconstruction. The experimental results demonstrated the feasibility of Bayesian image reconstruction without freely adjustable\\nhyper parameter.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThis elimination of the empirical trial-error selection of the hyper parameter will widen Bayesian reconstruction applications in clinic.\\n\\nSSPH06-06 Two Orders of Magnitude Accelerated Precision Tomographic Reconstruction Compared to OS-SART:\\n\\nApproaching the Speed and Simplicity of Filtered Backprojection\\n\\nParticipants\\nWolfram R. Jarisch, PhD, Potomac, MD (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nPeter J Basser, PhD, Bethesda, MD (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nwolfram@cyber-inc.us\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nWe now achieve computation speeds close to filtered backprojection with greater accuracy and precision than OS-SART. Numerical\\ncomparisons on an nVIDIA P4000 processor using cone beam reconstruction shows the new method at 79x the speed of OS-SART\\n\\n\\x0cused at CERN (Biguri et al.; IOP, Biomed. Phys & Eng.Expr, Vol 2 No 5).\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nWork by Wood and Morf (IEEE BME-28, 1981) implied the inability to solve practical tomographic reconstruction with least-squares\\nand Maximum Likelihood estimation (MLE) (Kalman Filter; Sage & Melsa; McGraw Hill, 1971). Current alternatives include: (i)\\nordered-subset sequential algebraic reconstruction techniques (OS-SART); and (ii) prior measurement distribution p(y) selection to\\nregularize an approximate voxel update p(x/y), while \\'unrolling\\' the non-linear iterative computation (Fessler, 2017; U. of Michigan:\\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.05927.pdf).\\n\\nEvaluation\\n\\nFrequently, a single filtered backprojection step is used to initialize an iterative reconstruction. Unfortunately, this operation is not\\ncontinued, and, for example, is replaced by gradient optimization steps, trained with a problem specific cost function. In this way,\\noptimization on a constrained density with a non-quadratic performance criterion, using only a small subspace of typically some 100\\nx 10^6 voxel variables, shows limited convergence (DeMan, et al. NSSMIC.2005.1596187, M11-339).\\n\\nDiscussion\\n\\nTo overcome limitations of the above methods, we proposeed and implemented a new tomographic reconstruction method. Derived\\nfrom a linearized approximate Kalman filter, \\'unrolling\\' iterations with progressive resolution, it uses filtered backprojection as an\\napproximate systems state predictor. This approach formulates 3D image reconstruction throughout all iterations as small-signal\\noptimal state estimation steps.

The study aimed to explore a predictive model\\nof LRR by using radiomic features extracted from pre-treatment radiotherapy planning CT.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\n104 early-staged lung cancer patients treated with SBRT (20 with LRR) were included, who were divided into training and validation\\nsets at a ratio of eight versus two with parallel clinical characteristics (p > 0.1). Radiomic features were extracted from gross tumor\\nvolume area on planning CT and were selected based on the minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm to build a\\nprediction model (Rad-score) for LRR in training set, whose performance (concordance index (CI), areas under receiver operating\\ncharacteristics curve (AUC)) were further evaluated in validation set. The optimal cutoff of Rad-score was determined by the\\nmaximum Youden index, by which patients were then divided into high and low risk groups and log-rank test was accordingly\\nperformed to distinguish the group difference in cumulative probability of LRR. Significant clinical factors in univariate cox regression\\ntogether with Rad-score were included to build the final model and its performance was assessed accordingly.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nTwo radiomic features, glcmFeatS_StdS_jointAvg and glcmFeatS_StdS_clustShade, were selected into the Rad-score, achieving a\\nCI of 0.73 (0.62-0.84), and AUC of 0.764 and 0.714 in training and validation set, respectively. And the incidence of LRR was\\nsignificantly (P = 0.005) higher in high-risk group than low-risk group in training set. When combined with significant clinical factors\\n(tumor location), the CI was improved to 0.78 (0.67-0.89), while its AUCs were changed to 0.832 and 0.671 in training and\\nvalidation set, respectively. In contrast with low-risk group, the cumulative probability of LRR was higher in high-risk group in both\\ntraining (P < 0.001) and validation (P < 0.1) sets.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nCombined with clinical factors, radiomic features are capable to predict LRR at an early stage after SBRT and distinguish high-risk\\ngroup from the others, facilitating earlier salvage therapy.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nRadiomic analysis can be applied in clinical practice for prognostic value of several clinical outcomes and help with physician with\\nclinical decision.\\n\\nSSRO04-02 Deep Learning based Segmentation of Clinical Target Volume and Contralateral Breast for Breast\\n\\nCancer Radiotherapy\\n\\nParticipants\\nHaibin Chen, Guangzhou, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nYa Cheng, Guangzhou, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nShuyu Wu, Guangzhou, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nPeiliang Xie, Guangzhou, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJun Wei, Guangzhou, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nYao Lu, PhD, Ann Arbor, MI (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nWei Wang, Tianjin, China (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo develop clinical practicable automatic segmentation method for clinical target volume (CTV), including breast CTV, CTV in the\\nsupraclavicular lymphatic region (CTV_SL) and CTV in the internal mammary lymphatic region (CTV_IM), and the contralateral\\nbreast(conbreast) in breast cancer (BC) radiotherapy (RT).\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\n\\x0cA novel convolutional neural network with orientation attention (OANet) is developed for three CTV regions and con-breast\\nsegmentation in BC RT. OANet is an inception block based pyramidal network, which could achieve a larger perceptive field for\\nfeature extraction. To avoid the influence of similar features in the left and right (LR), anterior, and posterior (AP) direction in model\\ntraining, two novel strategies are adopted in this study. 1) a direction attention map is calculated based on a formula as: APi=1-i⁄H,\\nwhere i and H are the row index and image resolution along with AP directions, respectively.Then, the product of AP direction\\nattention map and the normalized CT image is used as the input of OANet, where the CT images is clipped to the gray range of [-\\n300, 300] and then normalized to the range of [-1, 1]; 2) a channel-specific local Dice loss is employed for the model training,\\nwhich is the total of ipsilateral Dice loss for CTVs and the contralateral Dice loss for conbreast calculated based on a pair of loss\\nmasks with 1 in ipsilateral and 0 in contralateral or the opposite. The proposed method is trained and tested on 80 CT images from\\n80 patients with manually delineated contours of breast CTV, CTV_SL, and CTV_IM. 60 patients are used for training, and the rest\\nare for testing. The segmentation accuracy is quantitatively evaluated by the Dice\\'s coefficient (DSC). Higher DSC indicates more\\naccurate OAR segmentation.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe proposed OANet achieved superior performance over UNet with mean DSCs improved from 78.3(±9.7)%, 78.3(±15.2)%,\\n77.8(±9.7) and 80.2(±12.3)% to 83.8(±8.3)%, 80.4(±13.0)%, 80.0(±7.3) and 87.2(±10.5)% for breast CTV, CTV_SL, CTV_IM, and\\nconbreast, respectively.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe accurate quantitative and qualitative evaluation results demonstrate the proposed OANet is effective in automatic contours\\ndelineation of three CTV and conbreast for BC RT.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThe proposed CTV and conbreast automatic segmentation method is helpful for inproving the effecient and reducing the inter&intra\\ndelineater variabilities in clinical delineation work\\n\\nSSRO04-03 Deep Learning-based Breast and Organs-at-risk Segmentation in CT with Uncertainty Quantification\\n\\nfor Radiation Therapy after Breast-Conserving Surgery\\n\\nParticipants\\nJimin Lee, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nHyungjoo Cho, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nSung-Joon Ye, PhD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nDoo Ho Choi, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nWon Park, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nHaeyoung Kim, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nWon Kyung Cho, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nHee Jung Kim, PHD, Seoul, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nheejung0228.kim@samsung.com\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo investigate a novel Deep Learning-based breast and organs-at-risk (OARs) segmentation technique in CT with uncertainty\\nquantification for radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThe whole dataset consisted of CT images and RT structure files (RS) of 400 patients who underwent radiation therapy after\\nbreast-conserving surgery. The dataset was randomly divided into 320 patients\\' data for training stage and the other 80 patients\\'\\ndata for test stage. Each 3D segmentation map (used as a target) was acquired from contours of breast and three OARs, left lung,\\nright lung, and heart from RS reviewed by four radiation oncologists independently.To develop a Deep Learning-based auto-\\nsegmentation technique, a published 3D Convolutional Neural Network architecture (SCNAS-Net) optimized by Scalable Neural\\nArchitecture Search (SCNAS) was implemented. In the training stage, the model was trained to classify voxels of CT volume into\\none of four organs under 5-fold cross-validation (CV).To evaluate the segmentation performance of the trained SCNAS-Net, dice\\ncoefficients (DICE) between the outputs from the model and the targets were calculated during the test stage. In addition, we\\napplied test time augmentation and deep ensemble to capture the data and model uncertainty respectively.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe trained SCNAS-Net showed superior segmentation performance for all organs. Average DICEs of five trained models from the 5-\\nfold CV for the breast, left lung, right lung, and heart were 0.8370, 0.9801, 0.9749, and 0.9340, respectively. Although the\\nsegmentation task was much more difficult due to the various shape, volume, and location of the breast, the average DICE for the\\nbreast was significantly high. For the uncertainty quantification, the results mainly focused on the unseen or rare cases such as\\nthe presence of the heart contour. These results could improve the safety when applying our proposed method in the real clinic, by\\nnot only providing the auto-segmentation results, but also providing a mechanism to quantify risks.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe novel Deep Learning-based breast and OARs segmentation technique has been successfully developed and shown superior\\nsegmentation performance with uncertainty quantification.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThe proposed breast and OARs segmentation technique in CT can effectively reduce the time for the manual contouring of breast\\nand OARs during radiation therapy planning.\\n\\n\\x0cSSRO04-04 Prediction of Pathological Complete Response after Neoadjuvant Chemoradiotherapy in Locally\\n\\nAdvanced Rectal Cancer - T2-weighted Radiomics versus Diffusion-weighted Radiomics and Utility of\\nDifferent Machine Learning Classifiers\\n\\nParticipants\\nWenjing Peng, Beijing, China (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nHongmei Zhang, MD, Beijing, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nLijuan Wan, Beijing, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\npengwenching@163.com\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nWe develop and validate radiomics models based on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) for\\npredicting pathologic complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT)in patients with locally advanced rectal\\ncancer (LARC) and attempt to determine the optimal machine learning method.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nA total of 170 patients were divided into a training set and a validating set in the ratio of 7:3, all of whom underwent MRI\\nexaminations before and after nCRT (pre- and post-nCRT). True response to nCRT was assessed by total mesorectal excision\\n(TME). Radiomics features were extracted from pre- and post-nCRT T2WI and DWI. Radiomics models were developed with principle\\ncomponent analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction, ANOVA for feature selection and three kinds of classifiers of support vector\\nmachine (SVM), linear discriminate analysis (LDA) and random forest (RF) for the final classification. The performance was assessed\\nvia area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and\\nnegative predictive value.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nTwenty-seven of 170 patients (16%) achieved pCR. A full set of 1409 radiomics features was achieved each modality per scan.\\nRadiomics model based on post-nCRT DWI got higher AUC compared with the other three sequences of pre-nCRT T2WI, post-nCRT\\nT2WI and pre-nCRT DWI (AUC, 0.904 versus 0.677, 0.651, 0.599, P=0.023, 0.004, 0.012 on RF; 0.866 versus 0.581, 0.587, 0.657,\\nP=0.068, 0.002, 0.056 on SVM; 0.858 versus 0.581, 0.587, 0.590, P=0.078, 0.001, 0.044 on LDA) in the validating cohort. RF\\nafforded higher AUCs than SVM and LDA in most sequences, though not statistically significant.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nRadiomics features based on post-nCRT DWI show a good performance in predicting pCR after nCRT in LARC. RF is potentially\\noptimal classifier in the current cohort.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nUse of DWI radiomics may improve the confidence of radiologists in selecting patients with pCR for watch-and-wait strategy in\\nLARC after nCRT. The exploration to identify optimal classifier is a constructive attempt, which may set a start for further research.\\n\\nSSRO04-05 The Change in Radiomics for Predicting Pathological Complete Response After Neoadjuvant\\n\\nChemoradiotherapy in Locally Advanced Rectal Cancer\\n\\nParticipants\\nLijuan Wan, Beijing, China (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nHongmei Zhang, MD, Beijing, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nWenjing Peng, Beijing, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nlijuanwan1993@163.com\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo evaluate the value of radiomic features (RFs) that were based on the change on MRI between before and after neoadjuvant\\nchemoradiotherapy (nCRT) for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer\\n(LARC).\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nA total of 172 patients with LARC were included in the retrospective study (training set=121; test set = 51). All patients were\\nexamined using MRI before and after nCRT. 1049 RFs were extracted from pre- and post-nCRT T2-weighted images, respectively.\\nThe absolute change in RF (△-RF) was calculated by subtracting RF of post-nCRT from that of pre-nCRT. The relative change in RF\\n(△-RF%) was defined as the reduction rates from pre-nCRT to post-nCRT RF. Feature selection methods including LASSO were\\nused to choose the key features for building the △-RF and △-RF% signature. Logistic regression was used to construct the\\nradiomic signatures combined model. A clinical plus conventional radiological model and a combined model including clinical,\\nconventional, and radiomic information were constructed. The diagnostic performance of different models was evaluated by receiver\\noperator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Net reclassification index (NRI) was preformed to compare the predictive value of pCR\\nbetween the clinical plus traditional radiological model and combined model.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nIn the △-RF and △-RF% signature, 7 RFs were retained, respectively. The △-RF and △-RF% signature, radiomic signature\\ncombined model, and clinical plus conventional radiological model yielded AUCs of 0.804-0.853 and 0.799-0.831 in training and test\\nsets. The combined model achieved the highest AUC of 0.883 and 0.875 in training and test sets. Adding radiomics information to\\nclinical plus conventional radiological model significantly improved the predictive value for pCR (training set: NRI=0.692, p<0.001;\\ntest set: NRI= 0.520, p=0.044).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\n\\x0cOur study demonstrated that the change in RFs from per- and post-nCRT MRI can improve pCR prediction when integrated with\\nclinical and conventional radiological features and thus were promising to assist in clinical decision making.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nOur study proved that the combined model including radiomics information outperformed the clinical plus conventional radiological\\nmodel in predicting pCR. These findings could contribute to select patients for an organ-preserving strategy .\\n\\nSSRO04-06 Application of Diffusion Kurtosis Imaging in Evaluating Treatment Response After Neoadjuvant\\n\\nChemoradiotherapy in Rectal Cancer\\n\\nParticipants\\nZiqiang Wen, Guangzhou, China (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nYiyan Liu, Guangzhou, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nYan Chen, Guangzhou, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nYuru Ma, MD,MD, Guangzhou, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nXinyue Yang, Guangzhou, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nShen Ping Yu, Guangzhou, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nmedwzq@163.com\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo explore the feasibility and value of diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) in assessing treatment response quantitatively of neoadjuvant\\nchemoradiotherapy (NCRT) for patients with rectal cancer.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nA total of 78 patients with rectal cancer received NCRT were enrolled in this study. All the patients underwent conventional\\ndiffusion-weighted imaging (b = 0, 1000mm/s2) and DKI (b = 0, 200, 600, 1000, 1500, 2000mm/s2) on MRI scanner before (pre-X)\\nand after (post-X) NCRT. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), mean kurtosis (MK) and mean diffusivity (MD) were manually\\nmeasured by two radiologists independently. Based on the pathological tumor regression grade (pTRG) scores, all patients were\\ndivided into good responder group (pTRG1-2) and poor responder group (pTRG3-5). Student t test and Mann-Whitney U test were\\nused for statistical analysis. Receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) analysis were performed and the area under ROC curve\\n(AUC) values were used for assessing diagnostic value.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nFor the measurements before NCRT, the difference between parameters of good responder group and poor responder group was not\\nstatistically significant. After NCRT, post-MK in good responder group was significantly lower than that of poor responder group\\n(0.768 vs. 0.865, P < 0.001), while both post-ADC and post-MD were significantly higher in good responder group than that of poor\\nresponder group (1.005×10-3mm2/s vs. 0.935×10-3mm2/s, P = 0.012 and 1.951×10-3mm2/s vs.1.693×10-3mm2/s, P < 0.001). In\\ndiscrimination of treatment response, post-MD derived from DKI model had a relatively high AUC (0.746), with a sensitivity of\\n74.19% and a specificity of 74.47%.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nPost-ADC, post-MD and post-MK are able to discriminate good responders and poor responders. Post-MD derived from DKI model\\nshows highest diagnostic performance in treatment response assessing.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nDKI model can distinguish good responder from poor responder for rectal cancer after NCRT and is recommended in the quantitative\\nevaluation for treatment response.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSVI05\\n\\nVascular/Interventional (Interventional Oncology: Liver Cancer)\\n\\nThursday, Dec. 3 2:00PM - 3:00PM Room: Channel 5\\n\\nHP\\n\\nED LM PR SQ\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .50\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSVI05-01 A Study on the Effect of Inhibiting Tumor Angiogenesis After Embolization in the Treatment of Liver\\n\\nCancer with Apatinib Loaded p(N-isopropyl-acrylamide-co-butyl methylacrylate) Temperature-\\nsensitive Nanogel\\n\\nParticipants\\nChen Zhou, Wuhan, China (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nzhouchenjr@126.com\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo investigate the underlying mechanism and therapeutic potential of combining transcatheter arterial embolization (TAE) with\\nApatinib loaded p(N-isopropyl-acrylamide-co-butyl methyl acrylate) temperature-sensitive (PIB) nanogel on suppressing rabbit VX2\\nliver tumor growth.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\n65 VX2 tumor-burdened rabbits were randomly divided into five groups and treated transarterially with Apatinib-loaded PIB (Group\\nPA) 0.4 ml (n=13); PIB alone (Group P) 0.4ml (n=13); iodized oil alone (Group I) 0.4ml (n=13); Apatinib solution (Group A) 0.4ml\\n(n=13); saline (Group NS) 0.4 ml (n=13), respectively. The dose of Apatinib was 2 mg/kg. Tumor harvest, sectioning and Immuno-\\nhistochemistry, and the tumor growth rates and survival time of each group were measured. Blood samples and liver tissue were\\ncollected for pharmacokinetic analysis.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nThe tumor growth rate of Group PA was considerably lower than the other four groups (P=0.000<0.01), and the survival time was\\nsignificantly prolonged (P=0.000<0.01). The result of immunohistochemistry showed that CD31 staining of Group PA was\\nsignificantly lower than that of the other four groups (P=0.000<0.01). Apatinib concentration in blood falls below 10ng/ml in 10\\nminutes after TAE and drops below 1ng/ml after 8h. The drug was released continuously in the liver for 36 days, with the highest\\nconcentration at the tumor junction (P=0.045<0.05).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nApatinib is targeted to liver cancer tissues through PIB, achieves a slow and sustained release of the drug in the tumor, and\\nconsiderably reduced the systemic drug concentration. Further experiments showed a significant prolonging survival time and\\ninhibitory effect for tumor growth.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThis study is expected to provide new targets and therapeutic strategies for interventional treatment of HCC, and this way has a\\ngood application prospect.\\n\\nSSVI05-02 Integration of 3D Quantitative Tumor Burden Analysis into the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Staging\\n\\nSystem: Updated Treatment Approach to Hepatocellular Carcinoma\\n\\nParticipants\\nTabea Borde, New Haven, CT (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nNariman Nezami, MD, Atlanta, GA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nFabian M.

A quantitative 3D-analysis was performed on baseline contrast-enhanced MRI to determine thresholds of ETV and\\nETB (ratio between ETV and liver volume). Accordingly, BCLC stage B and C patients were separately stratified by high and low\\ntumor burden and re-assigned to new independent BCLC \\'Bn\\' or \\'Cn\\' cohorts by stepwise verification of median overall survival\\n(MOS) and validation using Kaplan-Meier plots and log-rank test. Uni-and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to identify\\ncovariates with a significant association with MOS.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nETV (HR 2.5 [CI 95% 2.0-3.0], p<0.001) and ETB (HR 2.1 [CI 95% 1.5-2.9], p<0.001) were identified as the strongest predictors of\\nMOS. MOS of the patient cohort was 11 months. The ETV threshold was determined to be 65 cm3, the ETB cut-off was 4%. After\\nreassignment of 152 low tumor-burdened BCLC stage C patients (ETV < 65 cm3/ ETB < 4%) to BCLC Bn, MOS of newly assigned\\nBCLC Bn patients rose from 24.2 to 25.1 months, validated by a significant separation of the Kaplan-Meier curves (p < 0.001). The\\n59 high tumor-burdened BCLC B patients (ETV >= 65 cm3/ ETB >= 4%) still showed a survival advantage of 21.1 months when\\ntreated with TACE and remained in BCLC class Bn.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nETV and ETB were strong predictors of survival. While BCLC B patients are likely suitable for TACE regardless of tumor burden, 3D\\nquantitative imaging may help to refine selection of appropriate BCLC stage C patients to benefit from loco-regional therapy.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nBCLC stages B and C represent highly heterogenous patient populations, and further refinement is needed to significantly improve\\nclinical outcomes and prolong patient survival.\\n\\nSSVI05-03 Primary Tumor Location is a Prognostic Factor for Intrahepatic Progression-Free Survival in Patients\\n\\nwith Colorectal Liver Metastases Undergoing Portal Vein Embolization as Preparation for Major\\nHepatic Surgery\\n\\nParticipants\\nLea Hitpass, MD, Aachen, Germany (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nMaximilian F.

IhPFS after PVE was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.\\nUnivariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses were conducted to investigate the association between the following factors\\nand ihPFS: Patient age, laterality of the colon cancer (right- vs. left-sided), time of occurrence of hepatic metastases\\n(synchronous vs. metachronous), baseline number and size of hepatic metastases, presence or absence of metastases in the\\nfuture liver remnant (FLR) before PVE, and history of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy. Mean follow-up was 22.7 months.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nAfter PVE,10/60 patients developed progressive disease and did not proceed to surgery. The remaining 50 patients underwent\\nhepatectomy after PVE and of those, 28 (47%) developed intrahepatic metastatic recurrence. The median ihPFS among all 60\\npatients was 7.8 months (0.95 CI:5.3-10.3 months). Laterality of the primary colon cancer was the only statistically significant\\npredictor of ihPFS after PVE (hazard ratio=2.293; 95%-CI: 1.171,4.494; p=0.016), with patients with right-sided colon cancer\\nhaving significantly shorter median ihPFS than patients with left-sided cancer (5.7±1.4 months vs. 10.2±1.5 months;log rank test:\\np=0.013).

Two-sample t-test, Chi2-test and\\nKolmogorov Smirnov test were used for statistical analysis, and intraclass correlation coeffficient (ICC) was used for evaluating IQ\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nDoes area product for fluoroscopy was significantly lower in group 2 (1.4±1.1 Gy.cm2) vs. group 1 (2.8±3.4 Gy.cm2; p=0.001). For\\nDSA dose area product was significantly lower (p=0.003) in group 2 (2.2±1.2 Gy.cm2) vs. group 1 (4.7±2.3 Gy.cm2). Scores for\\nDSA IQ indicated signficant improvements for group 2 by 30% vs. group 1 (p=0.004). Regarding fluoroscopy scores for IQ were 76%\\nhigher in group 2 compared to group 1 (p=0.001).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nThe most current generation robotic angiography equipment allows signficant dose reductions while significantly improving image\\nqualilty in fluoroscopy and DSA image guidance during cTACe treatment of malignant hepatic tumors.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nSecond generation robotic angiography technology allows cTACE of the liver at more than 50% lower radiation dose levels with\\nbetter image quality vs. the first generation system.\\n\\nSSVI05-05 Development of Interventional Real-Time Optical Imaging-Guided Complete Tumor Ablation\\n\\nTechnique\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Fellow\\n\\nParticipants\\nXuefeng Kan, MD,PhD, Seattle, WA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nGuanhui Zhou, MD, Seattle, WA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nFeng Zhang, MD, Seattle, WA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nChuansheng Zheng, Wuhan, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nXiaoming Yang, MD, PhD, Mercer Island, WA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\nxmyang@uw.edu\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo develop an indocyanine green (ICG)-enhanced interventional optical imaging (OI) for intraoperatively detecting residuals of\\nablated tumors.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nThis study included three portions: (1) optimizing protocol for ICG-enhanced OI via serial in-vitro experiments; (2) building the\\ninterventional OI system; and (3) validating its technical feasibility via serial in-vivo experiments. For optimizing ICG protocol,\\n1×104 VX2 tumor cells were labeled with various ICG concentrations (0 to 125 μg/mL) and different incubation times (0 min to 48\\nh). ICG-VX2 cells were treated by an ablation heat at 80?. Fluorescence signal intensities (SI) of different cell groups were\\nmeasured by optical/x-ray imaging and cell viability evaluated by MTS assay. For in-vivo validation, we built the interventional\\noptical imaging system with a micro-OI needle. Then, rabbit models with hepatic VX2 tumors were randomly divided into two\\ngroups: (1) incomplete radiofrequency ablation (RFA) at 80? by partially opening the RFA electrode; and (2) complete RFA at 80?\\nby fully opening the electrode. Pre- and post-RFA, the micro-OI needle was positioned to image liver parenchyma and tumor\\nperiphery, followed by measuring signal-to-background ratio (SBR) at six points for statistical analysis, which was correlated to final\\npathology confirmation.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nOf in-vitro experiments, the optimal concentration and time-window for ICG-enhanced OI were 100 μg/mL at 24 hours. ICG SI of\\ndead cells was significantly lower than untreated living cells (63.7±5.7 au vs. 189.3±7.6 au, p<0.001). Of in-vivo experiments, ICG-\\nenhanced OI shows that SBR of residual tumor with incomplete RFA was significantly higher than ablated tumor (2.30 ± 0.08 vs.\\n0.58 ± 0.05, p<0.001), while SBR of tumors with completed RFA significantly decreased compared to pre-ablation tumors (0.59 ±\\n0.03 vs. 2.29 ± 0.04, p<0.001). These SBR changes were well correlated with \\'standard\\' ex-vivo optical imaging and confirmed by\\npathology (Figure).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nWe are developing a new interventional oncologic technique for intraoperative real-time guidance, to ensure the complete tumor\\n\\n\\x0cremoval during an interventional ablation session.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nThis new technique may open new avenues for intraoperative optical imaging guidance, to ensure the complete tumor removal\\nduring an interventional ablation session.\\n\\nSSVI05-06 Stereotactic Microwave Ablation (SMWA) of Malignant Liver Lesions Using MRI/ CT Fusion for\\n\\nTargeting of \"Invisible\" Lesions\\n\\nParticipants\\nMartin H.

The purpose of our study was to assess\\nthe technical feasibility of MRI/CT fusion for lesions invisible on CT planning scans and its outcome in patients treated with\\nstereotactic microwave ablation (SMWA).\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nPatients who underwent SMWA between January 2015 and December 2018 were retrospectively analyzed. All liver lesions for which\\nMRI/CT fusion was performed due to invisibility on pre-interventional CT planning scans were included and reassessed. The endpoint\\nwas successful ablation of the lesion at first follow-up imaging.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nDuring the study period, 236 patients underwent 312 SMWAs with ablation of 496 lesions. Twenty-four lesions in 15 patients (mean\\nage: 62 years; range, 43 - 80 years) were included. Following MRI/CT image fusion, all 24 lesions were sufficiently visible to perform\\nSMWA. The first follow-up imaging showed complete ablation of 22 lesions. Two initially incompletely ablated lesions were\\nhepatocellular carcinomas, and were successfully re-ablated afterwards.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nSMWA with MRI/CT image fusion is an efficient and safe treatment option for patients with liver lesions not detectable on contrast-\\nenhanced CT planning scans.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nUsing MRI/CT image fusion may allow more patients with malignant liver lesions to benefit from locally ablative therapies even if\\ntheir lesions are not visible on CT planning examinations.\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cSSVI06\\n\\nVascular/Interventional (Interventional Oncology)\\n\\nSaturday, Dec. 5 3:30PM - 4:30PM Room: Channel 4\\n\\nCT GI GU SQ IR\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .50\\n\\nFDA  Discussions may include off-label uses.\\n\\nSub-Events\\nSSVI06-01 Magnetic Resonance Navigation System for Supra-Selective Embolization of the Liver: In Vivo\\n\\nDemonstration\\n\\nParticipants\\nCyril Tous, PhD, Montreal, QC (Presenter) Support, Siemens AG\\nNing Li, Montreal, QC (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nSimon Lessard, PhD, Montreal, QC (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nUrs O.

An injector delivered 220µm MDEB aggregates through a catheter balloon positioned in the proper hepatic\\nartery. The magnetic force from the MRI gradient and the gravitational forces were used in combination to steer aggregates to the\\nsegmental artery feeding the tumor. Beforehand, a segmentation of the arterial tree from DSA/CTA data was performed to\\ndetermine the optimal animal position to optimize gravitational force and plan the timing and orientation of steering gradients. The\\nsegmentation was co-registered with MR-angiography. The aggregate was tracked with a True-FISP before the MRN steering\\nsequence, and its location after embolization was determined with T1 VIBE. The flow was controlled by partial inflation of the\\nballoon catheter and measured using 2D cine-phase sequence. Finally, we simulated in 19 patients with a total of 32 nodules of\\nhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) the optimal patient\\'s position for MRN.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nAfter MRN in the pigs, 82% of the aggregates reached the targeted left medial lobe (Fig 1-1). Without MRN, 95% of the aggregates\\nwere heading into the right lobe (Fig 1-2). We could localize MDEB aggregate in the target segmental artery and release of MDEB in\\nthe target segment after removing the pig from the B0 field (Fig 1-5). The controlled flow dropped the velocity from 35 cm/s to 15\\ncm/s at systole and from 10 cm/s to 5 cm/s at diastole. Partial inflation of the balloon created a slow pulsatile flow propelling\\naggregates while minimizing friction force. In humans, the simulation showed that 100% of nodules could be reached within 2\\nbifurcations for the left lobes (14HCC), and 3 bifurcations for the right lobe (18HCC). Only 2 nodules out of the 32 (6.2%) would\\nhave been rejected for MRN.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nWe obtained a level of selectivity close to a super selective catheterization and superior to a lobar injection using MRN of MDEB.\\nThis concept could be apply to perform serial segmental embolization using an implantable arterial port\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nSegmental liver embolization with MRN tracks MDEB from delivery to target, minimizing tissues at risk. It could eliminate the need for\\nrepeated invasive catheterization procedures and provide ability to treat diseases in the advanced-stage by combining it with intra-\\narterial chemotherapy.\\n\\nSSVI06-02 Percutaneous Lymphatic Intervention for the Treatment of Postoperative Lymphatic Ascites Related\\n\\nto Pelvic Surgery: Analysis of Factors Affecting Outcome\\n\\nParticipants\\nKyung-Min Lee, Gyeonggi-do, Korea, Republic Of (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nJinoo Kim, Suwon, Korea, Republic Of (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\ndlrudals2332@gmail.com\\n\\n\\x0cPURPOSE\\n\\nTo assess the outcome of lymphangiography and lymphatic embolization for the treatment of postoperative lymphatic ascites\\noccurring after pelvic surgery and to assess factors related to outcome.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nTotal 72 patients (100 cases) who had undergone percutaneous lymphatic intervention between May 2015 - January 2019 for the\\ntreatment of postoperative lymphatic ascites were included (daily discharge of >500 mL). Patient demographics, extent of lymph\\nnode dissection, volume of daily discharge via surgical drains, amount of drainage at the time of drain removal and complications\\nwere retrospectively reviewed. Time interval between lymphatic intervention and drain removal were reviewed. On the\\nlymphangiography and CT images, findings of inguinal intranodal lymphangiography and embolization techniques, and delayed\\ncomplications were reviewed. Failure to remove drains due to refractory discharge or development of recurrent ascites or\\nsymptomatic lymphocele after drain removal were considered treatment failure. Logistic regression analysis was performed to\\nidentify factors related to outcome of lymphatic intervention.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nLymph node dissections performed during gynecologic (n=6), urologic (n=3), and rectal surgery (n=1) accounted for postoperative\\nascites (most commonly dissected nodal stations are both pelvic & para-aortic levels, n=66). The mean amount of discharge was\\n1313 mL/day (chylous in 6 patients and non-chylous in the remainder). Lymphangiography was successfully performed in 72 patient.\\nAdditional embolization was performed in 24 patients. Drains were eventually removed in 70 patients (97.2%) after a mean number\\nof 1.36 sessions during a mean period of 13.8 days. For those in whom the drains were removed, high-output leak was successfully\\nmitigated to low output leak of < 300 mL/day (n=70). Treatment failure was observed in 12 patients (16.7%) who developed\\nrecurrent ascites or symptomatic lymphoceles after drain removal. Chylous ascites and discharge > 300 mL/day were associated\\nwith higher re-intervention rate. Larger amount of preprocedural discharge was associated with higher likelihood of drain removal >\\n2 weeks. Transient lymphedema (n=3) was the only complication.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nLymphatic intervention is effective for converting high-output leaks to low-output leaks after pelvic surgery and is associated with\\nhigh rate of drain removal. High-output discharge and chylous nature of discharge is associated with higher likelihood of re-\\nintervention.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nLymphatic intervention is effective for reducing inpatient days of postoperative lymphatic ascites patients.\\n\\nSSVI06-03 Radiofrequency Ablation in Combination with an mTOR Inhibitor Restrains Pancreatic Cancer Growth\\n\\nInduced by Intrinsic HSP70\\n\\nParticipants\\nShanshan Gao, Shanghai, China (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nNing Pu, PhD,MD, Shangahi, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nHanlin Yin, PhD,MD, Shanghai, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nGuofeng Zhou, PhD,MD, Shanghai, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nWenhui Lou, PhD,MD, Shanghai, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nLingxiao Liu, Shanghai, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nJun Yu, MD, Baltimore, MD (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nXiaolin Wang, MD, Shanghai, China (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\n17111320002@fudan.edu.cn\\n\\nPURPOSE\\n\\nTo reveal the impacts on immune patterns in pancreatic cancer microenvironment, and biological behaviors of residual cancer cells\\npost radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment, and then modify the current regimen to improve its therapeutic effect.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nRFA treatment was administered to preclinical murine cancer models that followed up with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\\nscanning. Immune cell subtypes and related cytokines were quantified in tumor tissues, peripheral blood and spleens to uncover the\\nimmune pattern changes post RFA treatment. Then, high-throughput proteome analysis was performed after in-vitro simulation to\\nidentify differential proteins associated with RFA, whose mechanism was further validated in vitro and in vivo experiments. Finally, a\\ncombined therapy was applied in preclinical murine cancer models to observe its therapeutic effect.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nIn the preclinical murine models with RFA treatment, no significant therapeutic benefit was observed from RFA treatment. However,\\nthrough analysis of the immune patterns, the proportion of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells was significantly increased, while that of\\nregulatory T cells (Tregs) was decreased post RFA treatment, which indicated as a beneficial anti-tumor environment.\\nConcomitantly, the secretion of INF-γ was enhanced, while the TGF-ß level was declined instead after RFA treatment. Surprisingly,\\nKi-67 activity was apparently enhanced in residual cancer cells. To find out the reason, high-throughput mass spectrum was\\napplied and identified the top differential protein, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70). HSP70 expression in residual cancer cells was\\nsignificantly increased post RFA treatment, which promoted the pancreatic cancer growth. Mechanistically, elevated HSP70\\npromoted proliferation via enhancing phosphorylation of AKT and then activating mTOR signaling whose down streams p70S6k and\\n4EBP1 were significantly phosphorylated. Finally, RFA treatment combined with an mTOR inhibitor exerted a synergetic repressive\\neffect on tumor growth in preclinical murine cancer models.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nRFA treatment in combination with mTOR signaling blockade can not only promote antitumor immune response but also restrain\\nresidual cancer cell proliferation resulting from HSP70 induced AKT-mTOR signaling activation.\\n\\n\\x0cCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nRFA treatment in combination with mTOR inhibitor may be a promising and effective strategy for LAPC patients.\\n\\nSSVI06-04 Computed Tomography-guided Percutaneous Microwave Ablation for T1a and T1b Renal Cell\\n\\nCarcinoma: A Single Institution Series\\n\\nParticipants\\nEvgenia Efthymiou, MBBS, Athens, Greece (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nOrnella Moschovaki Zeiger, MD, Athens, Greece (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nDimitrios Filippiadis, MD, PhD, Athens, Greece (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nStavros Spiliopoulos, MD, PhD, Athens, Greece (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nKonstantinos N.

Although microwave ablation offers theoretical advantages over the other ablation techniques\\n(radiofrequency, cryoablation), there is a lack in literature concerning the mid and long term results. The aim of our study was to\\nassess the effectiveness, safety, mid and long term efficacy of microwave ablation in T1a and T1b renal tumors.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nInstitutional databases retrospective research identified 58 patients who underwent computed tomography guided, percutaneous\\nmicrowave ablation for localized, biopsy proven (T1N0M0) renal cancer. Mean patient age was 71.2 years. Tumor stage was T1a in\\n66.7% and T1b for 33.3 % of the cases. The mean maximum tumor size was 3.4 ± 1.1 cm (range 0.8 to 5.9 cm). Contrast-\\nenhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was used for post-ablation follow-up. Patient and tumor\\ncharacteristics, microwave technique, complications and pattern of recurrence were evaluated.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nA second ablation due to residual tumor was performed in 5/58 (8.5%) patients. The mean progression free survival time from last\\nablation was 85.3 months. The cumulative progression free rate for 1, 6, 12 and 36 months were 96%, 93%, 93% and 93%\\nrespectively. The mean survival time from the last ablation was 28 months (SD= 26) with median equal to 16 months. Metastasis\\noccurred in 2 (3.45%) patients. Grade 1 complications (minor hematoma requiring nothing but observation) were recorded in 4\\n(6.8%) patients.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nPercutaneous microwave ablation of Renal Cell Cancer is a safe and efficacious technique for the treatment of T1a and T1b renal\\ntumors, with low tumor recurrence rates and satisfactory long term outcomes.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nPercutaneous MWA ablation seems to be an attractive alternative to radiofrequency and cryoablation for T1 renal tumors.\\n\\nSSVI06-05 Yttrium-90 Radioembolization as a Possible New Treatment for Brain Cancer: Results at Two Years\\n\\nfor Proof of Concept and Safety Analysis in a Canine Model\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Medical Student\\n\\nParticipants\\nSasicha Manupipatpong, BS, Baltimore, MD (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nAlexander S.

P1-4 had serial neurological exams, 1-, 3-, and 6-\\nmonth MRIs, and were subsequently followed indefinitely by our study veterinarians for symptomatic management.\\n\\n\\x0cRESULTS\\n\\nAs of RSNA 2019, P1, P3, and P4 remained grossly asymptomatic (11-, 8-, and 6-months post-procedure), P2 had been euthanized\\nper owner request at 5-months post-procedure, and P5 passed away 15 hours post-procedure.At 12-months post-procedure, P1\\ndeveloped left thoracic limb proprioceptive delay in addition to her existing left rear limb proprioceptive delay as observed at her 6-\\nmonth follow-up, though this did not suggest significant change in the known right cortical lesion. A 12-month MRI was performed,\\nwhich showed no interval change of the right frontal lobe mass. P1 remains seizure-free at 13 months.P3 remained asymptomatic\\nuntil 10 months post-procedure, when his seizures returned. As of 11-months post-procedure, an attempt to medically manage\\nthem with an increased antiepileptic dose is underway.At 6-months post-procedure, the volume of P4\\'s mass began trending\\ntowards pre-treatment size and seizure activity returned. Seizure activity continues to worsen despite increased anti-epileptic\\nmedication at 9 months post-procedure.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nY-90 ER in the canine brain is technically feasible and caused no permanent neurologic deficits. Four of five patient dogs had\\nfavorable dosimetric, radiologic, and long-term clinical outcomes, with three dogs currently alive 7-12 months beyond the 63-day\\nmean survival time associated with their original diagnosis and symptomatic treatment. Long-term outcomes, histopathology, and a\\nlarger sample size are needed to better understand brain Y-90 ER efficacy.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nGlioblastoma is the most common and aggressive type of brain tumor, with a median survival time of 15 months. Y-90 ER may\\nprovide increased treatment efficacy with decreased neurotoxicity.\\n\\nSSVI06-06 Pre-Treatment Computed Tomography-Guided Fiducial Localization of Pulmonary Nodules: Feasibility,\\n\\nSafety and Recurrence-Free Survival\\n\\nParticipants\\nNathan Elie Frenk, MD, Boston, MA (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nShaunagh McDermott, FFR(RCSI), Boston, MA (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nFlorian J.

However, there are no outcomes reported after CT-guided fiducial localization. The\\npurpose of this study is to assess the technical success rate of CT-guided fiducial localization of pulmonary nodules, surgical\\nlocalization failure rate, and recurrence-free survival.\\n\\nMETHOD AND MATERIALS\\n\\nA single-center, retrospective study was performed on consecutive CT-guided fiducial localization of lung nodules. Endpoints\\nincluded technical success of fiducial placement, surgical localization failure rate, and 1-year and 2-year recurrence-free survival.\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\n136 CT-guided fiducial localization procedures were performed on 128 patients (66% female; mean age, 64 years +/- 12) for 141\\nnodules (mean size, 11 mm +/- 5; mean distance to pleura, 10 mm +/- 8). The technical success rate was 98% (133/136). 134\\nnodules were resected during 126 operations performed 6 days +/- 16 after fiducial placement (range, 0-123). Surgical localization\\nfailure occurred in one case. Seventy-four of 133 resected nodules were invasive primary lung cancers, 16 were minimally invasive\\ncarcinoma, 7 were adenocarcinoma in-situ. Seventeen nodules were metastases, 1 was a carcinoid and 18 were benign. Among 46\\npatients who underwent a wedge resection of a primary lung cancer with at least 1 year of CT surveillance, and 34 patients with at\\nleast 2 years of CT surveillance, there was no evidence of local recurrence or intra- or extra-thoracic metastasis.\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nCT-guided fiducial localization of pulmonary nodules is safe, effective and results in a low surgical localization failure rate. One and\\ntwo-year recurrence rate after wedge resection for lung cancer is low.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nMinimally invasive techniques for resection of small nodules has resulted in the need for image guided techniques to aid localization;\\nCT-guided fiducial localization is a safe and reliable method\\n\\nPrinted on: 05/05/21\\n\\n\\x0cVSPD11\\n\\nPediatric Neuroradiology\\n\\nNR PD\\n\\nAMA PRA Category 1 Credit ™: .75\\n\\nSub-Events\\nVSPD11-A Corpus Callosum Agenesis: Prenatal MRI and Postnatal Outcome\\n\\nParticipants\\nDaniela Prayer, MD, Vienna, Austria (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\ndaniela.prayer@meduniwien.ac.at\\n\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n1) participants will be able to distinguish isolated from non- isolated Corpus callosum agenesis on Fetal MRI. 2) Recognize\\nmorphological brain abnormalities associated with Corpus callosum agenesis detect fetal brain abnormailites that may have an\\nimpact on the clinical outcome of fetuses with c Corpus callosum agenesis.\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n\\nAnomalies of the Corpus callosum may be associated with with favorable or unfavorable neuropsychological outcome. An important\\nrole for fetal MRI has become to predict the prognosis in these cases as accurate as possible. There, the most important\\ninformation is to decide whether the complete or partial agenesis of the Corpus callosum is combined with other brain anomalies,\\nsuch as, for instance, disorders of cortical development or pontocerebellar malformations. Patterns that are possibly based on a\\nchromosomal defect may be recognozed. In addition, even in isolated Callosal agenesis morphological landmarks have been defined\\nthat may indiate a more or less favorable prognosis in a respective case. This was done by a correlation of these landmarks with\\npostnatal neuropsychological tests. Thus MRI has become an important prenatal imaging tool, improving the management of\\npregnancies complicated by fetal brain malformations.\\n\\nVSPD11-B\\n\\nImaging of Posterior Fossa Anomalies\\n\\nParticipants\\nJason N.

Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) more than 90 days after cCTA were recorded. Several cCTA-\\nderived plaque measures and conventional CT risk scores together with cardiovascular risk factors were provided to a ML model to\\npredict MACE. A boosted ensemble algorithm (RUSBoost) utilizing decision trees as weak learners with repeated nested cross-\\nvalidation to train and validate the model was used. Performance of the ML model was calculated using the area under the receiver\\noperating characteristic curve (AUC).\\n\\nRESULTS\\n\\nMACE was observed in 31 patients (8.6%) after a median follow-up of 5.4 years. Discriminatory power was significantly higher for\\nthe ML model (AUC 0.96[95%CI 0.93-0.98]) compared to conventional CT risk scores including Agatston calcium score (AUC 0.84\\n(95%CI 0.80-0.87)), segment involvement score (AUC 0.88(95%CI 0.84-0.91)), and segment stenosis score (AUC 0.89(95%CI\\n0.86-0.92),all p<0.05). Similar results were shown for plaque measures (AUCs 0.72-0.82, all p<0.05) and clinical parameters\\nincluding the Framingham risk score (AUCs 0.71-0.76, all p<0.05). The ML model yielded significantly higher diagnostic performance\\nwhen compared to logistic regression analysis (AUC 0.96vs.0.92, p=0.024).\\n\\nCONCLUSION\\n\\nIntegration of a ML model improves the prediction of MACE when compared to conventional CT risk scores, plaque measures and\\nclinical information. ML algorithms may improve the integration of patient's information to improve risk stratification.\\n\\nCLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\\n\\nML based cCTA-derived plaque quantification and characterization may have utility in risk-stratifying the vulnerability of coronary\\nlesions for the prediction of future major adverse cardiac events.\\n\\nSSCA07-02 A Machine Learning Pipeline for Segmentation and Classification of Coronary Artery Calcium Lesions\\n\\nin Lung Cancer Screening CT's\\n\\nAwards\\nTrainee Research Prize - Resident\\n\\nParticipants\\nJordan Fuhrman, Chicago, IL (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\nRowena Yip, MPH, New York, NY (Abstract Co-Author) Nothing to Disclose\\nArtit C.

       "\"1) Provide a brief epidemiology of breast cancer in Malaysia. 2) Learn how geographical, sociocultural factors and financial/resource\\nconstraints including personal beliefs/preferences impact diagnosis and management. 3)The interactive case based review will take\\ninto consideration objective no. 2 and where applicable - when ideal has to be modified because of availability, accessibility,\\naffordability and acceptability.\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n\\nTitle: True 'Tales' of Breast Imaging in Malaysia Malaysia is a multicultural, multiethnic, small, middle-income country in South East\\nAsia. Breast cancer is the overall top cancer in Malaysia. Whilst early detection and optimal treatment for breast cancer and other\\nbreast conditions exist, the distribution of such services are in major cities especially on the west coast of Peninsula Malaysia,\\nmany centered around the capital of Kuala Lumpur. We have clinical practice guidelines for breast cancer management. There is no\\norganized population based screening mammogram program but over the years, opportunistic screening has increased due to rising\\nlevels of awareness. Barriers to even diagnostic mammograms include perception of pain; radiation risks and that compression can\\nspread cancer. Ultrasound is the most widely accepted imaging modality and therefore follow up compliance is relatively good,\\nsometimes preferred over immediate biopsy of even BI-RADS 4 lesions. Women may refuse a mammogram, even when clinically\\nindicated! Paradoxically, despite availability of MRI services in many major hospitals, specifically MRI breast is not widely available.\\nMRI is also expensive and requires Gadolinium contrast media. Factors for late presentation include fatalism, ignorance, fear of\\ncancer and belief in traditional therapies. Proliferative benign breast conditions are common. Our patients range from pre-pubertal\\nto the elderly and males. In addition, women fall prey to unlicenced injection breast augmentation. All these add to colorful but\\nchallenging situations, YET provide opportunities to connect with and counsel patients. Dealing with personal beliefs and\\npreferences despite standard of care recommendations is better than refusing them care at all and leaving them to their own\\ndevices. The spectrum of tales (clinical scenarios) will strive to illustrate the above. A handout is included for more in-depth\\ninformation of the Malaysian scene.\\n\\nMSCB51C Multimodal Approach to Breast Imaging: How It Works in Russia\\n\\nParticipants\\nKaterina A. Busko, St Petersburg, Russian Federation (Presenter) Nothing to Disclose\\n\\nFor information about this presentation, contact:\\n\\ndr.katerinabusko@gmail.com\\n\\nLEARNING OBJECTIVES\\n\\n1) To get acquainted with the features of the healthcare system and training of doctors in Russia. 2) Learn how women with breast\\npathology are examined in our country. 3) Find out what are the differences between breast imaging in here and in the other\\ncountries. 4) See the clinical cases, with different diagnostic methods which are used in Russia.\\n\\nABSTRACT\\n\\nMultimodality approach to Breast imaging. How it works in Russia. Katerina Busko Associate professor of Radiology N.N. Petrov\\nNational Medical Research Center of oncology Saint-Petersburg, Russia The Russian federation is the largest country in the world,\\noccupying 1/8 of the land area. Population of 146 million (2019) (78 million female, 68 million male). The World Bank has classified it\\nas a middle-income country. Overall life expectancy at birth is 72,60 years in 2019 (female 77,55; male 67,66 лет). There are more\\nthan 160 people living on the Russian Federation territory, in which the biggest one is Russian (111 millions of people or 77% of\\ncountry's population). Tatar (5,5mln of people), Ukrainian (about 2mln of people), Bashkir, Chuvashi, Chechen and Armenian which\\nnumbered more than 1 mln of people. Homogenous nature of the population with predominance of Russian nationality is typical only\\nfor Central, Central-Chernosem and North-Western regions, whereas all other regions especially Northern Caucasus have mixed\\nnational composition of population. Russia is unique country according to the religion structure population: there are\\nrepresentatives of three world's religions - Christian, Islam and Buddhism. The biggest cities are Moscow (capital) - 8 millions of\\npeople and Saint Petersburg - 5 millions of people. Being the most important center of economics, transportation, culture and\\nscience Saint Petersburg is still the heart of Russian history. The North capital, the city of three revolutions, Cultural capital,\\nNorthern Palmira, the city am Neva river, Northern Venice, the city of white nights - this is hardly a complete list of unofficial names\\nof Saint Petersburg. The public health care system (funded by general taxes) provides near universal healthcare coverage. Russia\\nspent 7 % of GDP on Healthcare in 2019. There are some differences in training radiation diagnostic doctors between Russia and\\nEurope and North America. After school (11 grades) graduation the future doctor should enter and graduate medical university (6\\nyears). To get the sub-specialty it's necessary to go through residency (2 years). The main difference is in opportunity to make\\nthe choice between specialty of radiologist and the sonographer. Not all of the doctors have two specialty (Radiologist and\\nSonographer). Therefore, the realization of multimodal method of breast imaging is only possible in the lead national institutions, as\\na rule these are the scientific-research centers of Moscow and Saint Petersburg. And this poses the main problem. Generally, in\\nRussia the patient is examined by three doctors: radiologist doctors which describes only mammogram, radiologist who describes\\nonly MRI and the doctor who perform ultrasound investigation. Too narrow specialization doesn't allow the doctors to see the full\\nimage of breast cancer diagnostics what sometimes could be the reasons of false positive and either false negative diagnoses.\\nWidely used BI-RADS system became compulsory in Russia about 5 years ago. Due to this, fact the doctors of different specialties\\n(radiologists, sonographers and oncologists) started to speak the same language. Stereotactic biopsy is performed by the\\nradiologist in specialized oncological institutions. In the great majority of cases the core biopsy is performed by the oncologist under\\nthe ultrasound control or by the surgeon together co-working with sonographer. Furthermore, we don't have a clear separation of\\nvisualization a certain organ, it means that the diagnosis doctor works while general appointment, e.g. he could examine organs of\\npulmonary system, gastrointestinal tract and breast. There were about 35667 of doctors who worked in X-ray diagnosis department\\nin 2016 representing 5% of total number of medical staff (16611of radiologists and 15083 sonographers specialists are among them)\\nAll the government health institutions in Russia are equipped with mammographs and US scanners. However, there is a place for a\\nlack of profile specialists who do diagnostics only for breast. As a rule, MR tomography can be found only in big cities and not all of\\nthem are equipped with breast coil. According to statistics of 2016, in government health care institutions they found: 5014 US\\ndepartments; 1520 mammographic screening cabinets, 465 MRI departments. Considering the fact that private clinics' go through\\nactive development in Russia now, so the amount of diagnostic machines has doubled [1]. In 2016 6,3 mln of mammograms were\\nperformed. Analyzing the MR researching structure we can find out that only 1% is accounted for breast imaging (about 8000) [1].\\nLeading localizations in the general structure of cancer morbidity are presented in: skin(12,6% with melanoma - 14,4%), breast\\n(11,4%), trachea, bronchus and lungs (9,9%), colon (6,9%), prostate (6,8%), stomach (5,9%), rectum (5,0%) lymphatic and\\nhematopoietic tissues (4,8%), corporis uteri (4,3%), kidney (3,9%), pancreas (3,1%), cervix uteri (2,8%), bladder (2,8%), ovary\\n(2,3%). Breast cancer is presented as the main cancer-related pathology among female population of Russia, accounted about\\n21.1% among all female malignant tumors. The average age of patients with breast cancer diagnosed for the first time with\\nmalignant tumors in Russia in 2017 was 61,4 years old. Malignant tumors of breast have its peak of relative importance in a group\\nage of 30-59 years old (16.1%) [2]. Prevalence rates of women breast cancer are increasing: from 42,7 per 100 hundred of people\\n\\n\""
