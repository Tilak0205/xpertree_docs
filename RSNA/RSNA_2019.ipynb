      "of these efforts. Specifically, we will begin with the origins of 2D Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) which has facilitated the\n",
      "development of interventional radiology. Subsequently the need for time-resolved MRA data led to the creation of accelerated data\n",
      "acquisition schemes in MR angiography which introduced the general concept of under-sampled data acquisition in the time domain.\n",
      "These efforts led to the development of time-resolved 3D Time-Resolved Imaging of Contrast Kinetics (3D-TRICKS MRA), an analog\n",

      "Diagnostic Radiology and Radiation Oncology have been closely aligned since their evolution from a single specialty, often residing in\n",
      "the same department, to the present day. Increasingly, imaging has proven essential to the successful design and delivery of\n",
      "radiation therapy for cancer. In the 1980s, when CT scanners became available, these machines were shared and used selectively\n",
      "for radiation treatment planning. Image-based planning then evolved such that CT simulators became standard equipment in\n",
      "radiation oncology departments. However, diagnostic CT images remained integral to the staging and follow up of patients treated\n",
      "by radiation oncologists. Magnetic resonance imaging more slowly integrated into radiation planning and delivery systems, but used\n",
      "for diagnostic purposes, it gave radiation oncologists critical information about the cancers they were treating with the excellent\n",
      "soft tissue resolution provided by these images. Initially fused with radiation planning images, MR imaging has also gradually moved\n",
      "into radiation oncology departments for external beam and brachytherapy planning, especially for gynecologic cancers. Recently,\n",
      "linear accelerators equipped with online MR imaging capabilities have enabled real time monitoring of tumor and organ motion during\n",
      "each treatment as well as the ability to adapt the dose specification as tumors change over the course of treatment. Defining and\n",
      "treating cancers with this level of precision has allowed for dose escalation with or without treatment acceleration, improved cure\n",
      "rates and decreased morbidity. In addition, these images themselves have become biomarkers, informing radiation oncologists of\n",
      "tumor response and identifying radiomic features, previously untapped, which provide a window into prognosis. PET imaging has\n",
      "provided similar diagnostic and prognostic information. Use of ultrasound to guide invasive brachytherapy procedures is an\n",
      "invaluable asset ensuring procedural accuracy and safety. Interventional radiology has further enabled strategic placement of\n",
      "radiation as well as expertise in mitigating radiation morbidity such as insufficiency fractures. Though often working apart,\n",
      "diagnostic radiologists and the images they interpret and share, are fundamental to the success of radiation therapy. Radiation\n",

      "ABSTRACT\n",
      "Neuroimaging techniques have provided a unique and unprecedented insight into the functioning human brain. The emergence of\n",
      "functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) made a tool available that enabled psychiatric researchers to examine with great\n",
      "anatomical detail the relationship between psychological phenomena and brain physiology. Yet, almost thirty years later, it is\n",
      "important to take a step back and examine how this tool has helped to elucidate physiological and pathological anxiety related\n",
      "processes and to specifically address the challenges that lay ahead. \n",
      "Historically, there are currently no biological markers for\n",
      "psychiatric disorders even more than 50 years after the rise of biological psychiatry. Second, most studies that are currently\n",
      "presented are not aimed to examine whether neuroimaging can be used as a biological marker for a particular disorder. Instead,\n",
      "neuroimaging studies focus on the ability to show differences in neural activation due to specific processing of information across\n",
      "groups not within an individual. Third, the characteristics of fMRI, i.e. changing blood flow as a function of energetic demand in\n",
      "parts of the brain, and signal to noise characteristics of fMRI, i.e. the influence of thermal, physical, and physiological noise on the\n",
      "signal, may be such that fMRI may not be usable as a biological marker on an individual basis. In clinical practice it is essential to\n",
      "Page 244 contents: know how a particular test result predicts the risk of a condition, i.e. does a particular person have the condition when he/she has\n",
      "a positive test result. Likelihood ratios are a unique approach to calculate the probability of the condition, while adapting for\n",
      "varying prior probabilities, i.e. the chance of having a condition at the outset. Positive Likelihood Ratio (PLR) is the ratio of the\n",
      "proportion of patients who have the target condition and test positive to the proportion of patients without the target condition\n",
      "who also test positive. Negative Likelihood Ratio (NLR) is the ratio of the proportion of patients who have the target condition who\n",
      "test negative to the proportion of patients without the target condition who also test negative. For example, a PLR > 10 may rule\n",
      "in diseases with a pre-test probability between 30% and 70%, i.e. when one is clinically uncertain. In comparison, a NLR of < 0.1\n",
      "may rule out diseases with this pre-test probability. These test characteristics can be easily used in a graphical interface, e.g. the\n",
      "Fagan Nomogram, such that the clinician can calculate the approximate probability of an individual having a pathological condition\n",
      "with a positive / negative test result. \n",
      "Unfortunately, we still do not know answers to some basic questions that we may hope to\n",
      "address using fMRI in individuals with psychiatric disorders. First, there is no general account of what brain processing may causally\n",
      "contribute to the establishing of anxiety disorders. For example, is there a universal mechanism that results in the development of\n",
      "psychiatric disorders, or is there a minimal set of processes that when they occur together produce clinically significant psychiatric\n",
      "problems? Second, we do not know the discriminative ability of fMRI, i.e. the degree to which differences in neural activation\n",
      "pattern can be related to different types of psychiatric disorders. Third, it is a wide open question whether neuroimaging can\n",
      "function as a test for individuals with psychiatric disorders. Imaging techniques have not contributed so far to improve diagnoses or\n",
      "treatment of psychiatric disorders. This is clearly the charge and challenge for the next decades.\n",

      "PET is a non-invasive imaging technique that provides reproducible and fully-quantitative information on preselected\n",
      "metabolic/signaling pathways. PET is highly sensitive, thus, requiring only small amounts of biomarkers to be used for visualization\n",
      "and quantification purposes. By comparison to high-resolution anatomical images PET images appear blurred, which is attributed to\n",
      "the positron range effects and the limited detector size of the PET ring systems.Today, clinical PET imaging systems are offered\n",
      "almost exclusively in combination with CT and MR systems. Combined PET/MR, in particular, offers a number of intrinsic\n",
      "methodological advantages over PET only. These include, the use of MR imaging (e.g., by means of MR navigators) to estimate\n",
      "involuntary patient motion as a pre-requisite for motion compensation, and, thus, subsequent improvement of PET image quality\n",
      "and quantification. Following appropriate motion compensation, PET data can be improved in quality and accuracy through the use\n",

      "ABSTRACT\n",
      "Within the first 6 hours of ischemic stroke onset, CT or MRI cannot detect histological changes indicating brain tissue infarction,\n",
      "because signs of tissue death are extremely subtle and hard to detect even with a microscope under experimental conditions. In\n",
      "this acute phase of ischemic stroke, the degree of regional ischemia triggers two types of tissue water content changes. Below a\n",
      "cerebral blood flow (CBF) of 30 ml/100gxmin the extracellular space shrinks and cells swell due to a shift of water molecules from\n",
      "the extracellular to the intracellular space (cellular edema). Diffusion weighted MRI (DWI) is highly sensitive to detect brain tissue\n",
      "with cellular edema and thus the pattern of brain tissue suffering from moderate to severe ischemia. Extended cellular edema\n",
      "predicts the development of space-occupying vasogenic edema with life-threatening mass effects (malignant edema). Pure cellular\n",
      "edema is not associated with net water uptake, thus does not affect the tissue's x-ray attenuation, and cannot be detected with\n",
      "CT. Ion depletion in the extracellular space triggers, however, net water uptake from capillaries with some rest-flow through special\n",
      "endothelium channels that can be blocked with low-dose glibenclamide. This edema type was called \"ionic\" and is observed in brain\n",
      "tissue with a CBF < 20 ml/100gxmin only, a threshold below which brain tissue cannot survive for more than 30 min. Ionic brain\n",
      "edema is thus a marker of irreversible ischemic injury. Because brain tissue water content correlates with tissue radiodensity, CT\n",

      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "The study sample was derived from a population-based screening cohort from 2008 to 2015. There were 739 women diagnosed with\n",
      "breast cancer at screening or within 12 months thereafter, and 8,066 women who remained healthy for at least 2 years. The digital\n",
      "mammograms were processed by three commercial AI algorithms (AI-1, AI-2 and AI-3). The area under the ROC curve was\n",

      "We retrospectively evaluated 356 patients with 506 malignant lesions, confirmed on surgery. All of the patients underwent DM, DBT\n",
      "and US as a first step and preoperative MRI after the confirmation of malignancy. Second look US was routinely performed to study\n",
      "additional lesions detected by MRI. For this study we reviewed the cancers detected by the conventional modalities (DM, DBT and\n",

      "RESULTS\n",
      "There were 444 cancers in group A (70 DCIS, 326 IDC, 48 ILC) and 48 additional cancers in group B (13 DCIS, 30 IDC, 5 ILC).\n",

      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "All patients with an indication for Spectral CT-coronary angiography (SCCTA) were administered 50ml of iodine containing contrast\n",
      "agent 2min before the regularly conducted contrast enhanced SCCTA with a second bolus according to standard protocol.\n",

      "an indication for invasive coronary angiography (ICA) additional optical coherence tomography (OCT) was conducted. The findings\n",
      "of CCTA und OCT were carefully matched and compared.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "In 68 patients 50 non-calcified plaques were detected by SCCTA. Mean density was 70 ± 56 HU. Mean Iodine uptake was 2.4 ±\n",
      "2.1mg/ml, respectively. There was significant correlation between iodine uptake and density of coronary plaques; r = 0.67, p <\n",
      "0.001. Eighteen patients had an indication for ICA and underwent additional OCT. Thirty-five plaques could by matched by both\n",
      "modalities. All plaques detected by SCCTA had a correlate on OCT while only 86% of the plaques detected by OCT could be\n",
      "detected in SCCTA. OCT detected 31 (67%) high risk plaques: Six Thin cab fibroatheromas (13%), 25 fibroatheromas (54%).\n",
      "Further 15 (33%) low risk plaques were detected by OCT: Three fibrocalcific lesions (7%), eleven cases of pathological intima\n",
      "thickening (24%) and one Early-onset fibroatheroma (2%). Mean iodine uptake in SCCTA was lower in high risk plaques (2.5mg/ml\n",

      "PURPOSE\n",
      "An early diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) is crucial but is challenging for resource-poor countries with a shortage of radiologists. An\n",
      "approach to solve this obstacle is to take photographs on chest X-ray (CXR) and interpret them using smartphones. We developed\n",
      "a transfer deep learning-based TB detection model (TBShoNet) for CXR photographs taken by a phone camera.\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "Three publicly available datasets, MIMIC-CXR, Montgomery, and Shenzhen were used for model pretraining, transferring, and\n",
      "evaluation, respectively. The 121-layer neural network was pretrained on MIMIC-CXR database containing 250,044 CXRs with 14\n",
      "pulmonary labels, which did not include TB. The model was then recalibrated for CXR photographs by using simulation methods to\n",
      "augment the dataset. Finally, the TBShoNet was built by connecting the pretrained model to an additional 2-layer neural network\n",
      "trained on augmented CXR images in Montgomery dataset (TB: 58; normal: 80). The photographs taken by five different phones\n",
      "from the CXRs in Shenzhen dataset (TB: 336; normal: 326) were used to test the model performance. Diagnostic performance was\n",
      "measured using area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for image-wise classification.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "TBShoNet demonstrated an AUC of 0.89 (confidence interval: 0.87-0.91) for TB detection. With optimal cutoff, sensitivity and\n",
      "specificity for classification were 81% and 84%, respectively.\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "Based on transfer learning and data augmentation, TBShoNet was built without training on TB CXR photographs. TBShoNet can\n",
      "detect TB on phone-captured CXR photographs and generalize across different datasets.\n",

      "Chest CT is an accurate tool for assessment and monitoring the pulmonary status of hospitalized patients with COVID-19\n",
      "associated lung disease. Artificial Intelligence (AI) deep learning has the potential to aid in automated and standardized evaluation\n",
      "of CT scans. This work aims to investigate the potential of 3D deep learning method to predict clinical outcomes of patients with\n",
      "COVID-19, based on chest CT.\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "632 chest CTs in patients with PCR-proven COVID-19 were correlated with the clinical outcome of admission to an ICU (N=69) or no\n",
      "admission to an ICU (N=563). An automated whole lung segmentation algorithm was developed and used to localize whole lung.\n",
      "Based on the local region-of-interest around the lung (a bounding box), a 3D deep learning-based algorithm for classification of\n",
      "clinical outcome labels were trained with 5-fold cross validation. Model performance for classification on chest CT was evaluated by\n",
      "overall accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "Classification models achieved overall accuracy of 92%, sensitivity 73%, and specificity 93.9%, despite an imbalanced dataset\n",

      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "We retrospectively analyzed admission chest CT scans of patients suspected for COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent reverse\n",
      "transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasal-pharyngeal swab. We evaluated two different epidemic phases that\n",
      "occurred in our hospital localized in Italy: the first period of high prevalence disease (High prevalence group, HPG), from 21st\n",
      "February to 7th March; a second period with reduced prevalence (low prevalence group, LPG) from 6th to 13th April, after 28 days\n",

      "Chest X-Rays are widely utilized in the evaluation of suspected COVID-19 associated airspace disease (AD), however have limited\n",
      "sensitivity. Chest CT is more accurate, but not performed routinely. We developed a novel method to quantify AD in chest X-ray\n",
      "based on chest CT.\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "Our reference standard is CT derived 3D quantification of percentage of lung volume involved by AD (ground glass opacities and\n",
      "consolidations), via a neural network algorithm trained on 1000 chest CTs in patients with COVID-19 (%volCT). Our method\n",
      "generates digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) by forward projections through the CT volume along the AP axis, processed via\n",
      "a super-resolution neural network. Our test data comprised 24 patients with positive RT-PCR for COVID-19 who underwent chest\n",
      "CT and chest X-ray less than 24 hours apart. CT derived 3D total lung and airspace disease segmentation was projected on the\n",
      "DRRs using quantitative maps of cumulative thickness of both lung tissue and AD through the anterior-posterior axis, adjusted to\n",

      "thoracic radiologists with over 10 years' experience independently manually segmented AD in the paired chest x-rays, whose results\n",
      "were averaged to generate a consensus percentage area of AD (%areaCXR).\n",

      "CT derived volumetric AD quantification (%volCT) mean was 24.3%, median 13.8% (range 0 - 77.3%); DRR derived area AD\n",
      "quantification (%areaDRR) mean was 24.4%, median 8.9% (range 0 - 81.8%); expert consensus on chest x-rays (%areaCXR) mean\n",
      "was 12.3%, median 8.3% (range 0 - 53.0%). Pearson correlation between %volCT and %areaDRR was 0.99 (p < .00001), between\n",
      "the 2 expert readers was 0.86 (p < .00001), between %volCT and %areaCXR was 0.70 (p < .001), and between %areaDRR and\n",
      "%areaCXR was 0.69 (p < .001). Figure 1 illustrates results in 3 representative patients.\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "The correlation between %volCT and %areaDRR was excellent. Expert readers underestimated the extent of AD on chest x-rays\n",

      "PURPOSE\n",
      "The majority of studies on automated lung nodule malignancy prediction utilize subjective labels provided by radiologists instead of\n",
      "using a histopathological reference standard. The aim of this study was to investigate the performance of a deep learning system\n",
      "that was trained using subjective labels from LIDC-IDRI by testing it on two independent datasets of nodules from the Danish Lung\n",
      "Cancer Screening Trial (DLCST) with histopathological proof or follow-up over a period of at least 2 years, and comparing\n",
      "performance with a panel of 11 clinicians and the clinically established Brock risk model.\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "We considered nodules annotated by at least 3 out of 4 radiologists from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. The malignancy ratings were\n",
      "averaged and indeterminate nodules were excluded resulting in 680 nodules (352 benign and 328 malignant) for development. We\n",
      "trained a deep learning system based on 2D multi-view CNN and 3D extension of VGGNet on the development set. We tested the\n",
      "system on two sets of nodules from DLCST. The first set, dataset A, consisted of 62 cancers and 120 random benign nodules and\n",
      "the second set, dataset B, consisted of the same 62 cancers and a size-matched group of 118 benign nodules. A group of 11\n",
      "clinicians, consisting of 4 radiologists, 5 radiology residents, and 2 pulmonologists, were tasked with grading the nodules on a\n",
      "continuous scale from 0 to 100. Finally, the Brock risk model was also applied to all nodules.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "On dataset A, the deep learning system produced an AUC of 0.941, which is better than the average clinician (0.892, p = 0.02) and\n",
      "comparable to the Brock model (0.924, p = 0.35). On dataset B, the system produced an AUC of 0.737, which is comparable to the\n",
      "Brock model (0.70, p = 0.268) but worse than the average clinician (0.80, p = 0.034).\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "The deep learning system trained with subjective labels performed comparably with humans and the Brock model but showed\n",
      "certain vulnerabilities when presented with large benign nodules. It is important to recognize the challenges involved in classifying\n",

      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "In 1,287 patients (median age: 64.9±10.8 years old; 48.6% male), body composition (defined as muscle mass and total adipose\n",
      "tissue (TAT) at level L3) was automatically quantified on routine abdominopelvic CT scans at time of lung cancer diagnosis using a\n",
      "deep learning system. To account for demographic differences, body composition measures were normalized with respect to race,\n",
      "age and sex based on z-scores calculated in a general outpatient population of >12,000 individuals. To investigate the association\n",
      "of body composition with overall survival, the lowest tertile of the normalized measures was used to define patients as having low\n",
      "muscle mass or low TAT. Cox proportional hazard models were adjusted for demographics, body mass index, cancer and treatment\n",
      "characteristics.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "Body composition was successfully quantified in all patients. Over a median follow-up of 1.8 years (event rate: 68.1% (877/1,287)),\n",
      "overall survival was significantly associated with a higher mortality in patients with low muscle mass (HR: 1.32; 95% CI, 1.13-1.54;\n",
      "p<0.001) and patients with low TAT (HR: 1.27; 95% CI, 1.07-1.50; p=0.005) compared to the reference groups. Stratified analyses\n",

      "To rule out cervical spine injuries (CSI), cervical spine CT (CSCT) is regularly applied for the initial evaluation of trauma patients.\n",
      "Patients with detected asymmetry of the lateral atlanto-dental interval (LADI) often undergo a supplementary MRI to rule out\n",
      "ligamentous injuries. We aimed to investigate the additional benefit of cervical spine MRI in trauma patients with LADI asymmetry\n",
      "and lack of other proven cervical injuries.\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "Page 426 contents: In this retrospective study all trauma patients were included that have undergone a CSCT in the emergency room between 03/2017\n",
      "and 08/2019. All patients with LADI asymmetry without other signs of cervical injury that underwent a supplementary cervical spine\n",
      "MRI were identified. These MRI examinations were re-evaluated by experienced (with >8 years of experience in trauma imaging),\n",
      "blinded readers regarding possible ligamentous injuries.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "146 out of 1553 patients (9.4%) presented a LADI asymmetry on initial CT examination. Out of these, 46 patients without other\n",
      "signs of cervical injuries received an additional MRI with LADI asymmetry as the only indication. On initial examination, 9/46 patients\n",
      "(19.6%) had cervical tenderness on palpation; 37/46 (80.4%) were asymptomatic. The mean LADI asymmetry was 2.54±1.33 mm.\n",

      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "In trauma patients with LADI asymmetry on CSCT, an additional MRI to exclude ligamentous injuries is only reasonable in\n",
      "symptomatic patients. The additional diagnostic value in clinically asymptomatic patients without any other proven cervical injuries\n",

      "benign/indolent tumors that can be monitored from clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC), the most common and aggressive form\n",
      "of cancer, would be valuable. Our goal was to assess the performance of a clear cell likelihood score (ccLS) derived from\n",
      "multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) across all clinical stages.\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "This was an IRB-approved, HIPAA-compliant retrospective analysis of prospectively generated clinical data. Prospectively assigned\n",
      "ccLS of renal masses between 06/2016 and 11/2019 were reviewed. ccLS were correlated with histologic diagnosis when available.\n",
      "Diagnostic performance for diagnosing ccRCC and post-test probabilities of ccLS were quantified by contingency table analysis.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "993 mpMRIs were prospectively assigned ccLS by 1 of 16 fellowship-trained radiologists. Of these, 463 renal masses (444 patients)\n",

      "The International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) staging system for cervical cancer was revised in 2018. Imaging\n",
      "evidence was included officially in the new staging system. 360°-three-dimensional transvaginal ultrasound (360°-3D TVUS) is an\n",
      "emerging, innovative diagnostic imaging tool. In this work, we aim to compare two-dimensional (2D) and 360°-3D TVUS with\n",
      "magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as the gold standard in assessment of vaginal invasion of cervical cancer and to determine if all\n",
      "parts of the vaginal are equally assessable with ultrasound.\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "Patients with macroscopically evident and histologically confirmed cervical cancer were staged using FIGO criteria and underwent\n",
      "MRI, and 2D and 360°-3D TVUS examination before treatment. When assessing vaginal invasion with 360°-3D TVUS and MRI, the\n",
      "vaginal was (virtually) divided into 12 points and 2 segments (the upper two-thirds, and the lower third of the vagina). The\n",
      "presence and the extent of vaginal invasion were recorded for each sector. Results of 2D, 360°-3D TVUS, and MRI were compared\n",
      "and reported in terms of percentage agreement and kappa value.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "A total of 36 consecutive patients were included in the work. All patients underwent 360°-3D TVUS without adverse reactions. The\n",
      "percentage agreement between 2D TVUS and MRI in assessing vaginal invasion (yes or no) was 75% (kappa, 0.491) and that\n",
      "between 360°-3D TVUS and MRI was 96.9% (kappa, 0.842). The results of 2D TVUS showed the following agreement with those of\n",

      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "The results of 360°-3D TVUS showed good agreement with MRI, which is less costly and more readily available than MRI and should\n",

      "(MQSA) mandates that patients receive a mailed \"recall\" lay letter informing them to return for additional follow-up imaging. MQSA\n",
      "states that the language used in this letter should be \"easily understood by a lay person.\" The Centers for Disease Control and\n",
      "Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommend that all written patient communication should have\n",

      "appropriate 6th grade reading level from a 12th grade reading level. This was implemented across all four of our institution's\n",

      "scans are important tasks in oncology image analysis for assessing disease progression and therapy response. Manual lesion\n",
      "measurement and segmentation are tedious, time-consuming and subject to inter-observer variability. To reduce this manual burden\n",
      "and inconsistency, we propose a unified framework (\"SEANet\") for automatic and joint lesion SEgmentation and RECIST Annotation\n",
      "on a variety of lesion types throughout the body with only one click guidance.\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "SEANet has two main parts performed by two convolutional neural networks. The first part extracts the lesion of interest with one-\n",

      "Spine fractures are powerful predictors of future spine and hip fractures. Yet, up to 30% go undiagnosed in the acute phase, often\n",
      "being missed on standard x-rays. Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for x-rays can potentially reduce the rate of missed vertebral\n",
      "fractures and facilitate early intervention. Most AI work in spinal evaluation on x-ray has focused on lateral images, with limited\n",
      "work on frontal images. Although such injuries are better seen on lateral views, many routine chest x-rays only include the frontal\n",
      "view. An AI pipeline that accommodates both frontal and lateral images, rather than just a single view, would be more robust to\n",
      "different imaging studies and could improve vertebral fracture detection.\n",
      "Evaluation\n",
      "We explored the value of using both frontal and lateral images to automatically identify chest x-rays with vertebral fractures,\n",
      "wedging and compression. EfficientNet-B4 networks were trained on frontal or lateral x-rays to differentiate images with and\n",
      "without these vertebral injuries. 7022 frontal (1126 positive) and 4175 lateral (1080 positive) images were used for training.\n",
      "Performance was evaluated on 2961 exams (495 positive; with 2834 frontals and 1664 laterals). We compared the performance of\n",
      "each model and their combination under various ensemble paradigms, including training an auxiliary network to combine outputs.\n",
      "AUCs of 0.838 and 0.833 were achieved by the frontal and lateral models, respectively. An optimal AUC = 0.882 was achieved with\n",

      "The results demonstrate the value of using both frontal and lateral x-rays to substantially improve vertebral fractures detection,\n",
      "despite favourability toward using lateral images in practice and literature. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to\n",

      "Using imaging-based approaches to determine TSS may identify a new population of patients eligible for stroke treatments. Our\n",
      "analysis represents a robust approach for evaluating multiple automated and radiologist-dependent methods on a single dataset.\n",
      "Moreover, the significantly higher sensitivity of the DL model means that this approach could increase the number of patients\n",
      "eligible for thrombolysis.\n",
      "Background\n",
      "Stroke is the fifth-leading cause of death in the United States. Interventions that focus on reperfusion of ischemic areas, i.e.\n",
      "thrombolysis, are only available to patients with a known time since stroke (TSS) up to 4.5 hours, but up to 27% of patients are\n",
      "ineligible due to unknown TSS. Research has sought to estimate TSS using imaging. Radiologists use diffusion-weighted imaging\n",
      "(DWI) and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) to assess signal mismatching regions representing ischemic, not yet\n",
      "infarcted, brain regions. In parallel, automated image analysis may be able to classify TSS, which could allow more patients to\n",
      "receive thrombolytic therapies.\n",
      "Evaluation\n",
      "Using diffusion MRI from 411 patients, we evaluate our deep learning (DL) model, a slicewise convolutional network, to classify TSS\n",
      "within 4.5 hours. We compare the performance of two other methods: radiologist assessment of DWI-FLAIR mismatch, and a\n",

      "Three board-certified neuroradiologists' assessments, based on majority vote, yielded a sensitivity of 0.47, a specificity of 0.89,\n",

      "Background\n",
      "In general radiography, inconsistency of brightness and contrast in initial presentation is a common complaint from radiologists.\n",
      "Inconsistencies, which may be a result of variations in patient positioning, dose and image processing, may lead to additional\n",
      "workflow by technologists and radiologists to adjust the images.\n",
      "Evaluation\n",
      "An algorithm (AI BC) was developed to improve the consistency in presentation by using a customized ResNet50 neural network\n",
      "trained to classify Xray images based on NxN classes of brightness and contrast combinations. More than 30,000 unique images\n",
      "from sites in US, Ireland and Sweden covering 31 anatomy/view combinations were used to train the model. During training, an\n",
      "image and a class were randomly selected, and each image was adjusted according to the class selected. The model achieved an\n",

      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "Depth images of 200 patients were recorded with a 3D camera mounted above the patient table of a CT scanner. Reference values\n",
      "were obtained using a calibrated scale and a measuring tape to train a machine learning algorithm that fits a patient avatar into the\n",

      "RESULTS\n",
      "Differences between values for height, weight and BMI were non-significant over all assessments (p > 0.99). The most accurate\n",
      "values for weight were obtained from the patient information (R² = 0.99) followed by the automated estimation via 3D camera (R² =\n",

      "gantry angulation, patient x, y, z head position relative to the beam isocenter, and whether right or left eye. The dose for each\n",
      "combination of parameters was expressed as lens dose per entrance air kerma (mGy/Gy)). Portions of the dataset were used for\n",

      "RESULTS\n",
      "Several different DL models were tested using various configurations of dense layers, activation functions and other factors. The\n",
      "best model found was a combination of eLU models derived from k-fold cross validation methods. The combined model has each k-\n",

      "Up-regulation of tumor PD-L1 expression can lead to a poor prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. The clinical outcome of\n",
      "PD-L1 therapy is related to the expression level of PD-L1. IHC is invasive and only reflects the expression of PD-L1 in a tiny fraction\n",
      "of a tumor. Hence, we developed a 89Zr labeled Atezolizumab as a probe (89Zr - Df- Atz), using xenograft mice to detect whether\n",
      "the PET imaging can reflect tumor PD-L1 expression.\n",

      "The fitted IRS was 88.34%, indicating that 89Zr-Df-Atz could effectively bind to tumor PD-L1, and the labeling reaction did not\n",
      "impair its antigen-binding ability. The biodistribution showed that liver uptake is highest in normal tissues, and the tumor-muscle\n",

      "The PET/MR imaging data of 100 NPC patients from a medical center were collected. The patients were randomly divided into\n",
      "training group (n = 70) and test group (n = 30). The pathological and clinical diagnosis results were used as the gold standard for\n",
      "diagnosis. We measured the metabolic parameters (SUVmax, MTV, TLG) of the NPC primary focus, and used AK software to extract\n",

      "echo (SPGR) sequence in detecting osseous abnormalities.\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "ZTE sequences of the knee were acquired in 100 consecutive patients (44 Female, 56 Male) using a 3T scanner in conjunction with\n",
      "standard MRI protocols. The average patient age was 40 years [13, 68] with an average BMI of 26.3kg/m2 [18.2, 41.5]. Clinical\n",
      "indications included pain (n=35), suspected internal derangement of knee (n=28), trauma (n=23), and evaluation of post-operative\n",
      "changes (n=14). In 18 patients, fractures were diagnosed. Three radiologists rated confidence in evaluating osseous abnormalities\n",
      "as well as image quality (e.g. artifacts, contrast) on a 5-grade Likert scale. In a subset of knees (n=57) SPGR sequences were also\n",
      "obtained, and diagnostic confidence in identifying osseous abnormalities was assessed, comparing ZTE and SPGR sequences. To\n",
      "obtain CT-like contrast, the grey values of both sequences were inverted. Significance was characterized with a dependent t-test.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "ZTE image quality was overall rated high by all reviewers with 90% scores >= 4 using the Likert scale. The diagnostic confidence in\n",
      "using ZTE over SPGR for osseous abnormalities was favorable and statistically significant with a mean Likert score of 3.13 for ZTE\n",
      "and 2.59 for SPGR (p-value: 0.017). Diagnostic confidence in using ZTE was rated 'definitely certain' in 97%, 85%, 71% and 73% of\n",
      "the cases for osteophytosis, subchondral cysts, fractures, and soft tissue calcifications, respectively. In 74% of cases with\n",
      "osseous findings reviewer scores indicated high confidence levels (score >= 4) that ZTE improved diagnostic certainty [versus 58%\n",
      "of the cases without osseous findings]. In 53% of cases with osseous findings reviewers indicated that ZTE would alter patient\n",
      "management [versus 41% of the cases without osseous findings].\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "Incorporating ZTE MRI sequences in the standard knee imaging protocol was technically feasible, improved diagnostic confidence\n",

      "As new surgical options are available to treat lymphedema, MRI has emerged as a potential primary diagnostic tool for assessment.\n",
      "Dermal backflow is considered a gold-standard diagnostic feature of lymphedema but requires lymphoscintigraphy. A specific pattern\n",
      "of superficial subcutaneous edema seen on non-contrast STIR MR images, which we termed the dermal rim sign (DRS), may provide\n",
      "an alternative method of diagnosis that is more accessible and less invasive. The goal was to determine if DRS on MRI is predictive\n",
      "of dermal backflow seen on lymphoscintigraphy in patients with secondary upper extremity lymphedema.\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "Bilateral upper extremity MRI and lymphoscintigraphy were performed on patients referred from the lymphedema clinic between\n",
      "March and October 2018. The sensitivity and specificity of DRS in detecting dermal backflow were calculated, and the locations of\n",

      "bone marrow edema in patients with acute wrist trauma.\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "Data from consecutive 141 patients (70 male) with acute wrist trauma who had undergone clinically indicated third-generation\n",
      "dual-source CT and 3-Tesla MRI examinations of the wrist within two days between April 2019 and March 2020 were retrospectively\n",
      "analyzed. Six radiologists, blinded to MRI and clinical data, independently evaluated conventional grayscale dual-energy CT series\n",
      "for the presence of fractures; after 8 weeks, readers reevaluated all cases using color-coded dual-energy CT VNCa reconstructions\n",
      "for the presence of bone marrow edema for three scaphoid zones according to the Mayo classification. Quantitative analysis of CT\n",
      "numbers on VNCa reconstructions was performed by a seventh blinded radiologist. Results from MRI evaluated by two separate\n",
      "blinded experienced radiologists (20 and 32 years of experience in musculoskeletal imaging) served as standard of reference.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "MRI revealed a total of 101 traumatic bone marrow edemas in 121 regions (25 distal, 72 central, 24 proximal). In the qualitative\n",

      "RESULTS\n",
      "The study cohort mean age was 55.2 ± 11.5 years and was majority male (69%). The median PFS was 106 days (IQR: 56-150.5\n",
      "days) and median OS was 207.5 days (IQR: 150.5-393.5 days). Pre-treatment MRI features alone had poor predictive value for OS\n",
      "and PFS. Post-treatment MRI features had high predictive value for OS (AUC=0.74-0.84 in training and AUC=0.71-86 in testing\n",

      "54 patients with newly diagnosed and recurrent glioma were included. Lesions were manually segmented (Fig1A, neurological\n",

      "PURPOSE\n",
      "Current studies comparing biopsy recommendations for thyroid nodules have been weighted towards nodules recommended for\n",
      "biopsy. In these studies, the American College of Radiology (ACR) TI-RADS biopsy recommendation rate (BRR) is 55% compared to\n",
      "70 to 83% for other guidelines. We hypothesized that the difference would be even greater if the BRR was assessed for all nodules\n",
      "detected on ultrasound. This study aimed to compare the ACR TI-RADS biopsy recommendation rate with other guidelines for\n",
      "nodules reported on diagnostic thyroid ultrasound.\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "7 radiology practices prospectively submitted thyroid ultrasound reports to the ACR TI-RADS registry between October 2018 and\n",
      "March 2020 for low-risk patients undergoing routine thyroid sonography. Data were collected using a structured reporting template\n",
      "with fields for ACR TI-RADS' five ultrasound categories plus nodule size.The nodules were categorized according to criteria from ACR\n",
      "TI-RADS, the American Thyroid Association guidelines (ATA), European TI-RADS (EU-TIRADS) and Korean TI-RADS (K-TIRADS) to\n",
      "compare BRRs.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "Complete data were available in 33687 nodules in 13600 patients. The median size was 1.2 cm. ACR TI-RADS classified 47%, 30%,\n",
      "and 8% of nodules as TR4, TR3, and TR5, respectively (Table 1). The distribution of risk categories for ATA, EU-TIRADS, and K-\n",
      "TIRADS was similar. ACR TI-RADS recommended 8773 (26%) biopsies, which was the lowest BRR (Table 1). Recommended biopsies\n",
      "by ATA, European TIRADS, and Korean TIRADS were 17421 (52%), 11681 (35%), 19224 (57%) and 16857 (50%), respectively. The\n",
      "proportion of TR3 and TR4 nodules that were recommended for biopsy was lower for ACR TI-RADS compared to other systems at\n",
      "18% and 30%, respectively. At the high suspicion level (TR5), the BRR was similar for all guidelines at 65-71%.\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "The distribution of nodules in risk categories are similar for all systems, but ACR TI-RADS recommends 25-50% fewer biopsies\n",

      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "A total of 111 patients with suspected SIH were retrospectively reviewed and divided into two groups according to spinal imaging;\n",
      "with spinal longitudinal extrathecal CSF collection (SLEC) group (SLEC +), and without SLEC group (SLEC -). Twenty non-SIH\n",
      "patients served as controls. PMCT images from all patients were evaluated for renal pelvis density in Hounsfield units (HU).\n",
      "Additionalnumber of meningeal cysts, and the presence of the hyperdense paraspinal vein were analysed.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "Of the 111 SIH patients 71 (64%) presented with an SLEC and 40 (36%) without. The adjusted renal pelvis density was\n",
      "significantly higher in suspected SIH in both groups (SLEC (+) and SLEC (-)) than in non-SIH controls (absolute difference: 75 and\n",

      "CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\n",
      "Spinal CSF loss as the reason for spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) has multiple reasons. It is widely believed that SIH is\n",
      "most commonly triggered by CSF leakage from the intrathecal into the epidural compartment. This is usually due to an\n",
      "osteodiscogenic microspur (calcified disc protrusion or spondylophyte) penetrating the dura, or less frequently to a rupture of a\n",
      "spinal nerve root diverticulum. Alternative pathomechanisms like the CSF venous fistula, may also be demonstrated on imaging. But\n",
      "there are still patients with the classic appearance of SIH, clinically and in imaging, where neither one of these two entities could\n",

      "By doubling the tube current with the same tube voltage, adequate diagnostic image quality of chest radiography was achieved\n",
      "when scanning through glass. The patient dose roughly stays unchanged due to glass attenuation of low energy x-rays. Radiation\n",
      "exposure due to x-ray scatter is generally well under regulatory limits in these non-standard imaging conditions.\n",
      "Background\n",
      "In response to a patient surge during the COVID-19 pandemic, portable x-ray equipment is used for imaging through the glass of ED\n",
      "isolation rooms or in outdoor triage tent areas. To maintain diagnostic image quality and radiation safety for patients and hospital\n",
      "staff in these conditions, we performed phantom evaluations for quantitative evaluation of image quality and exposure.\n",
      "Evaluation\n",
      "An anthropomorphic chest phantom was used for chest x-ray through a sliding glass door (Fig 1a). The entrance air kerma and\n",
      "beam half-value layer was measured and the Exposure Index (EI) was recorded. Acquisitions were performed with the glass door\n",
      "open (standard) and closed (through-glass) using routine techniques. The mAs was increased for the through-glass scan to match\n",
      "the EI of the standard scan for the anthropomorphic and an image quality phantom (IQP) to obtain contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR).\n",
      "Patient effective dose estimates were calculated via Monte Carlo (PCMXC20). A radiation scatter survey was performed to evaluate\n",
      "staff safety (Fig 1b).To facilitate patient triage and reduce potential exposure, tents were set up in a dedicated area of an outdoor\n",
      "parking lotand portable x-ray units were used \n",
      "to scan patients in one tent (Fig 1c). A radiation scatter survey was performed in\n",

      "PURPOSE\n",
      "Computed tomography (CT) of COVID-19 shows a relatively global effect through the whole lungs, mimicking many other lung\n",
      "abnormalities. This characteristic effect renders the difficulties in differentiating COVID-19 from other lung diseases. This work\n",
      "presents a novel method to relieve the difficulties.\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "The method aims to reduce the global effect through the 3D whole lung volume into 2D domain, where the anatomic land-markers\n",
      "along the z-axis, denoted as Lung Marks are used to eliminate axial variable so that the cross section at each z location has similar\n",
      "texture patterns for normal subjects. Our experiments indicated that 30 Lung Marks are sufficient to eliminate the axial variable.\n",
      "The method computes texture measures from each 2D cross section and maps the measures on to the corresponding Lung Mark,\n",
      "resulting in a profile along the z-axis. The difference of the profiles between two different abnormalities is the proposed sensitive\n",
      "merit to differentiate COVID-19 cases from others in CT images.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "To show the effectiveness of the proposed sensitive merit, 48 COVID-19 cases and 48 normal screening cases were used. Firstly,\n",
      "the lungs of each of the 96 cases were segmented, and the segmented whole lungs were labeled/registered to the 30 Lung Marks\n",
      "along the axial direction. Texture measures (traditional Haralick features) were computed from each axial cross image at the\n",
      "corresponding Lung Mark along the z-axis to generate the profiles of the proposed sensitive merit. A skew U shape distribution was\n",
      "observed in the vector distance of the texture measure between the normal and COVID-19 subjects. Individual Haralick features\n",
      "analysis showed the 12th feature with the most sensitivity. Histogram analysis showed higher intensity of COVID-19 subjects,\n",
      "which agrees with the manifestation of COVID-19, like ground glass opacity, consolidation, etc.\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "In this work, we presented a sensitive merit to differentiate COVID-19 cases from normal lung screen cases. The experimental\n",

      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "Prefilters mainly remove the low energy photons of the x-ray spectrum. Beam hardening artifacts are reduced and, most\n",
      "importantly, patient dose is significantly reduced since low energy photons are nearly completely absorbed in the patient and do\n",

      "Here, the potential of using finer gradations and thicker prefilters is investigated. To do so, semiantropomorphic liver phantoms\n",
      "containing iodine and soft tissue contrast inserts were simulated at different sizes: 15×10 (child), 30×20 (adult) and 50×40 cm\n",

      "PURPOSE\n",
      "The purpose of this study is to develop a convolutional-neural-network (CNN) CT noise reduction framework that utilizes a widely\n",
      "accessible natural (optical) image database. For training, CNN denoising algorithms often use CT projection data and noise insertion\n",
      "to synthesize CT images at different dose (noise) levels. However, limited access to projection data makes it difficult to implement\n",
      "this approach. Here we describe a training framework that uses a public natural image database and does not require projection\n",
      "data access.\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "The denoising framework uses transfer learning; noise realizations from repeated phantom CT scans are superimposed onto natural\n",
      "images to mimic CT images at different dose levels. ImageNet was used for this task because of its diverse feature space, high\n",
      "resolution, and low noise. Patches were extracted from ImageNet and scaled to match the Hounsfield unit range of CT images. Prior\n",
      "to each training epoch, noise patches were shuffled and added to natural images. The CNN was trained to remove the\n",
      "superimposed CT noise and restore the underlying natural image. A residual architecture was used containing 18 convolutional\n",
      "layers, each with 128 features, and a mean-squared-error loss function. The technique was tested on 150-micron resolution\n",
      "thoracic CT images acquired from 5 patients on a research photon-counting-detector (PCD) CT scanner. Noise and edge sharpness\n",
      "were visually assessed, noise was measured in the aorta and sharpness quantified using line profiles.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "The CNN reduced noise by 74.2 ± 0.2 % compared to images created using filtered back projection and a sharp reconstruction\n",
      "kernel. Visual and line profile assessments demonstrated that fine anatomic details were preserved in the denoised images. In the\n",
      "shoulder, the sharp boundary of cortical bone was well maintained and noise reduction in the trabecular bone regions improved\n",

      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "The developed CNN denoising framework provides extensive noise reduction while maintaining fine anatomic features. Because this\n",
      "method uses only phantom scans and publically available data, it can be easily implemented.\n",
      "CLINICAL RELEVANCE/APPLICATION\n",

      "PURPOSE\n",
      "Percutaneous ablation is an established technique for the treatment of small localized renal tumors, especially in the elderly\n",
      "population and co-morbid patients. Although microwave ablation offers theoretical advantages over the other ablation techniques\n",
      "(radiofrequency, cryoablation), there is a lack in literature concerning the mid and long term results. The aim of our study was to\n",
      "assess the effectiveness, safety, mid and long term efficacy of microwave ablation in T1a and T1b renal tumors.\n",
      "METHOD AND MATERIALS\n",
      "Institutional databases retrospective research identified 58 patients who underwent computed tomography guided, percutaneous\n",
      "microwave ablation for localized, biopsy proven (T1N0M0) renal cancer. Mean patient age was 71.2 years. Tumor stage was T1a in\n",
      "66.7% and T1b for 33.3 % of the cases. The mean maximum tumor size was 3.4 ± 1.1 cm (range 0.8 to 5.9 cm). Contrast-\n",
      "enhanced computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging was used for post-ablation follow-up. Patient and tumor\n",
      "characteristics, microwave technique, complications and pattern of recurrence were evaluated.\n",
      "RESULTS\n",
      "A second ablation due to residual tumor was performed in 5/58 (8.5%) patients. The mean progression free survival time from last\n",
      "ablation was 85.3 months. The cumulative progression free rate for 1, 6, 12 and 36 months were 96%, 93%, 93% and 93%\n",
      "respectively. The mean survival time from the last ablation was 28 months (SD= 26) with median equal to 16 months. Metastasis\n",
      "occurred in 2 (3.45%) patients. Grade 1 complications (minor hematoma requiring nothing but observation) were recorded in 4\n",
      "(6.8%) patients.\n",
      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "Percutaneous microwave ablation of Renal Cell Cancer is a safe and efficacious technique for the treatment of T1a and T1b renal\n",
